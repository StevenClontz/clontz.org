If you're looking for support for your project related to
mathematics, research, education, technology, infrastructure, or puzzles,
please reach out to me at <steven@clontz.org>. My experience as
a content creator, advisor, evaluator, developer, community organizer,
and more allows me to support a wide variety of projects, and I look 
forward to learning more about yours.
