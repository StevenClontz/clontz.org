## Life

![My gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f9ecf8e56d48c8fd7adff7a8b5400bb?size=400)

I grew up in the suburbs outside Huntsville, Alabama, graduating from
Buckhorn High School. Following that I
spent eleven years at [Auburn Univeristy](http://www.auburn.edu),
eventually earning my PhD in mathematics
with specializations in topology and game theory, co-founding and running
the small web application-based business along the way.

I met my wife Jessica while she was studying education at Auburn, and
we married in June 2011. Since then she has earned two
masters degrees in educational leadership and library media, and currently
works as a public school media specialist.

Currently we live and work in Mobile, Alabama, where
I serve as Associate Professor of Mathematics at the
[University of South Alabama](http://southalabama.edu).
