Steven Clontz is a [mathematician](/math/), [professor](/teaching), and
[puzzle designer](/puzzles/) based out of the University of South Alabama
in Mobile, Alabama. His puzzles and games have been featured at such venues as
the National Museum of Mathematics in New York City. His published research
specializes in the intersection of topology and game theory, characterizing the
structure of topological spaces by the amount of information required to win at
certain games. Dr. Clontz uses active learning techniques such as Inquiry-Based
and Team-Based Learning in his classrooms to allow his students discover
mathematics for themselves rather than blindly memorizing algorithms without
understanding why. He also serves as director of Mathematical Puzzle Programs,
which designs and organizes puzzle events at college campuses and math camps
across the world.

## Life

![My gravatar](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f9ecf8e56d48c8fd7adff7a8b5400bb?size=400)

I grew up in the suburbs outside Huntsville, Alabama, graduating from
Buckhorn High School. Following that I
spent eleven years at [Auburn Univeristy](http://www.auburn.edu),
eventually earning my PhD in mathematics
with specializations in topology and game theory.

I met my wife Jessica while she was studying education at Auburn, and
we married in June 2011. Since then she has earned two
masters degrees in educational leadership and library media, and currently
works as a primary school educator.

Currently we live and work in Mobile, Alabama, where
I serve as Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the
[University of South Alabama](http://southalabama.edu).
I also occasionally work as a freelance consultant in the areas of
[mathematics](/math/), [mathematics education](/teaching/),
and [game and puzzle design](/puzzles/). These days I'm pretty picky with
the projects I take on, but if you have a cool idea for a collaboration,
please shoot me an
[email](mailto:steven.clontz@gmail.com) to get in touch!
