## Life

I grew up in the suburbs outside Huntsville, Alabama, graduating from
Buckhorn High School. Following that I
spent eleven years at [Auburn Univeristy](http://www.auburn.edu),
eventually earning my PhD in mathematics
with specializations in topology and game theory.

I met my wife Jessica while she was studying education at Auburn, and
we married in June 2011. Since then she has earned two
masters degrees in educational leadership and library media, and currently
works as a primary school educator.

Currently we live and work in Mobile, Alabama, where
I serve as Assistant Professor of Mathematics at
[South Alabama](http://southalabama.edu). I am also an active freelance
consultant and puzzle designer - shoot me an
