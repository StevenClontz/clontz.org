What's the fourteen-character message hidden in the video above, referring
to a location in Auburn, Alabama? (from Auburn Puzzle Party 5)

## What's so cool about puzzles?

I came to puzzles as a mathematician,
because *mathematics is the art of solving problems*, and *puzzle design
is the art of creating fun problems to solve*.
There are [many kinds](/puzzles/types/), and I love to work with
them all.

## Consulting and Design

I'm available to design your next custom puzzle event. These experiences
are great team-building activities, not to mention a lot of fun for your
organization. [Email me](mailto:steven.clontz@gmail.com) to discuss
how we can create the perfect puzzling occasion.

## Puzzlehunts

I'm particularly interested in puzzlehunts: large-scale events which involve
teams of players solving puzzles, which can end up sending them across an
entire campus or town to find the solution.

### Auburn Puzzle Community

![Puzzlehunt](/img/puzzlehunt-2.jpg)

I played and won my first
[Auburn Puzzle Party](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com) in 2009, and
lead a team of puzzle designers to create Auburn Puzzle Parties 4 and 5 from
2010-2012. I've also developed multiple Auburn Puzzle Potluck concepts putting
designers in head-to-head competition.

I retired from competitive puzzling in Auburn in 2016. During my tenure,
I tied the community record for most first place wins, and I still hold
the longest active streak of the first place wins in Auburn puzzlehunts.
My trohpies include four
[Eric's Puzzle Parties](http://www.ericharshbarger.org/epp/) and
two Auburn Puzzle Parties.

### AMP'd Challenge

In 2012, I teamed with fellow AU graduate student Braxton Carrigan
to create the
[Auburn Mathematical Puzzle (AMP'd) Challenge](http://www.auburn.edu/academic/cosam/departments/outreach/programs/AMPd/index.htm).

![AMP'd Logo](/img/ampd.jpg)

Our goal was to expose mathematical topics traditionally underrepresented
in grade school classrooms to middle school students. More
importantly, we wanted to present mathematics as critical thinking and
problem solving in a fun enviornment, rather than the rote memorization
of rules and formulas. Not only that, but it was a great
way to introduce students to Auburn University's campus, i.e. a great
recruiting tool.

AMP'd has been a huge success at Auburn, mostly thanks to the continued
support from current AU mathematics graduate students who
develop the game from year to year. Auburn now runs annual events for both
middle school and high school students at capacity.

### Mathematical Puzzle Programs

![MaPP](http://mappmath.org/img/logo/banner_color.svg)

Due to the ridiculous success of AMP'd at Auburn, I saw a demand
for expanding the availability for these sorts of educational experiences
across the country. To meet this demand I founded
[Mathematical Puzzle Programs (MaPP)](http://mappmath.org), and thanks
to the hard work of several colleagues who collaborated with me
on this venture, we launched in spring 2016 with high school puzzle
competitions at five diffrent college campuses
from Texas to Connecticut.

As Director of MaPP, I will double that number in 2017,
including an expansion to Australia and the introduction of a middle
school competition in partnership with the AMP'd Challenge.

### The National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath)

![MoMath](/img/momath.png)

I am a regular consultant with the National Museum of Mathematics,
including taking lead of the design for the
[2016 MoMath Dimensions Puzzlehunt](http://dimensions.momath.org),
an annual mathematical puzzle challenge held on the museum's campus
in New York City.

### JoCo Cruise 2016

![JoCo](/img/joco.svg)

While I won't be on board, I contributed an original puzzle for
the 2016 [JoCo Cruise](https://jococruise.com/) Puzzlehunt.

### USC Puzzlehunt

![USC Puzzlehunt](/img/usc-puzzle.png)

In 2016 I was a remote competitor in the annual
[USC Puzzlehunt](http://uscpuzzlehunt.com/).

### Leadership in the Zombie Apocolypse

![MaPP](/img/zombies.png)

In partnership with [The Leaders Foundry](http://www.theleadersfoundry.com/)
I developed a puzzle challenge
for people managers in their "Leadership in the Zombie Apocolypse"
training. The Leaders Foundry uses this
event as a final test of the skills they cover in their People
Manager Developer Program.
