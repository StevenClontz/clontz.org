I am a researcher in general topology, serving as a tenured
associate professor at the [University of South Alabama][usa].

[usa]: http://southalabama.edu

My specializations include:

- selection principles and games
- limited information strategies in selection games
  and other topological games
- characterizations of covering properties
- generalized inverse limits indexed by arbitrary partial orders

I am also heavily involved in the development of modern
**cyberinfrastructure** for mathematics research and instruction,
particularly the production of
[next-generation mathematical documents](https://pretextbook.org)
and
[semantically searchable mathematical databases](https://topology.pi-base.org).

In addition, my work as a mathematician strongly influences my
[teaching](/teaching/) and [game and puzzle design](/puzzles/).
