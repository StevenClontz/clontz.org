I am a published researcher in
set-theoretic topology and continuum theory.
My specializations include applications
of game theory in topology and the study of generalized
inverse limits indexed by arbitrary total orders.

Of course, my work as a mathematician strongly influences my
[teaching](/teaching/) and [game and puzzle design](/puzzles/).

## Publications

An overview of my work in mathematics may be found on
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Clontz)
and the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Clontz_S/0/1/0/all/0/1).

## Research Statement

An overview of my research is available with my
[CV on GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz/cv).
