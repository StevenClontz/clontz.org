I am a researcher in general topology, serving as a tenured
associate professor at the [University of South Alabama][usa].

[usa]: http://southalabama.edu

My specializations include:

- selection principles and games
- limited information strategies in selection games
  and other topological games
- characterizations of covering properties
- generalized inverse limits indexed by arbitrary partial orders

I am also heavily involved in the development of modern
cyberinfrastructure for mathematics research and instruction,
particularly the production of
[next-generation mathematical documents](https://pretextbook.org)
and
[semantically searchable mathematical databases](https://topology.pi-base.org).
As of writing I am an investigator on two National Science Foundation-funded
projects related to this work.

- [POSE: Phase I: An Open-Source Ecosystem for the Creation and Use of Accessible Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Open Education Resources](https://prose.runestone.academy/)
- [Transforming Lower Division Undergraduate Mathematics Through Team-Based Inquiry Learning](https://sites.google.com/southalabama.edu/tbil/)

In addition, my work as a mathematician strongly influences my
[teaching](/teaching/) and [game and puzzle design](/puzzles/).
