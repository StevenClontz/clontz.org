Aside from the math intrinsic in [puzzling](/puzzles/) and
[programming](/code/), I am a published researcher in
set-theoretic topology and continuum theory.
My specializations include applications
of game theory in topology and the study of generalized
inverse limits indexed by arbitrary total orders.

## Publications
