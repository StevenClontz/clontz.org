I am a published researcher in
set-theoretic topology and continuum theory, serving as a tenure-track
assistant professor at the [University of South Alabama][usa].

[usa]: http://southalabama.edu

My specializations include:

- selection principles and games
- limited information strategies in selection games
  and other topological games
- generalized inverse limits indexed by arbitrary total orders and bonded
  with idempotent maps

In addition, my work as a mathematician strongly influences my
[teaching](/teaching/) and [game and puzzle design](/puzzles/).

## Publications

An overview of my work in mathematics may be found on
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Clontz)
and the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Clontz_S/0/1/0/all/0/1).

## Research Statement

An overview of my research is available with my
[CV on GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz/cv).
