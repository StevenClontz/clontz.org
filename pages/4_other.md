My programming experience covers a variety of platforms and
languages, including Ruby, Python, and Javascript.
Naturally, a lot my work in those languages involves web development,
but I've been known to hack on a few other types of projects
as well.

I'm a strong believer in open-source. If it weren't for free languages and
libraries I'd never have picked up programming as a hobby, much less a
vocation. By working as a community, we can create robust and secure
applications for the betterment of society. Two of my major open-source
projects are the [Checkit](https://checkit.clontz.org) framework I maintain
for authoring and generating randomizable outcomes-based assessments,
and the [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) project I contribute to which
allows authors to semantically describe the content of scholarly documents
such as textbooks and research papers, and export this content to accessible
HTML, printable PDF, tactile braille code, and more.

During graduate school, I co-founded
`Teloga.com` (no longer in service), a CRM for
collegiate music organizations which operated from 2011-2015. It
was built on Ruby on Rails (previously Django) and Angular.

My [GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz) has a bunch of my repos if
you want to see what I'm working on these days.
