I've been known to dabble in a few other areas, in particular
entrepreneurship and software development.

My programming experience covers a variety of platforms and
languages, including Ruby, Python, and Javascript.
Naturally, a lot my work in those languages involves web development,
but I've been known to hack on a few other types of projects
as well.

I'm a strong believer in open-source. If it weren't for free languages and
libraries I'd never have picked up programming as a hobby, much less a
vocation. By working as a community, we can create robust and secure
applications for the betterment of society.

My largest project so far was co-founding and developing
[Teloga.com](http://teloga.com), a CRM for
collegiate music organizations which operated from 2011-2015. It
was built on Ruby on Rails (previously Django) and AngularJS. I've also done
technology consulting for organizations such as the
[AU Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://auburn.edu/math/)
and the [National Museum of Mathematics](http://momath.org).

My [GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz) has a bunch of my repos if
you want to see what I'm working on. You can also check out
my [CV](http://github.com/StevenClontz/cv).
