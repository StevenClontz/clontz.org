By shading the cells which are multiples of nine (perhaps by using the
theorem, but you probably have them memorized anyway... I couldn't
fit more than two digits per cell!), a QR code leading to this page is revealed.

![Card Solution](/img/puzzle-qr.svg)

It's possible to do draw the QR code by hand (particularly if you used the larger
version on my site, rather than the tiny version on the physical card),
thanks to the
[error correction](http://blog.qrstuff.com/2011/12/14/qr-code-error-correction)
built into QR code generation.

Fun fact, the URL for this page `clontz.org/foo` was chosen because I could
only fit at most 14 characters without increasing the resolution of the QR code.

There's not much to this puzzle, but I wanted
something simple to put on the back of my card. Congrats for solving it!
