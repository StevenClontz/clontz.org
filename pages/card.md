**Theorem: An integer is a multiple of nine iff the sum of
        its digits is a multiple of nine.**

*Proof:*
Express the integer as the sum of its digits:
\\(d_0+10d_1+100d_2+\\dots+10^nd_n\\).
This may be grouped into the sum of its digits
\\(d_0+d_1+\\dots+d_n\\) plus the sum
\\(9d_1+99d_2+\\dots+(10^n-1)d_n\\). Since each
\\(10^i-1\\) is divisible by 9, the result
follows. \\(\\Box\\)
