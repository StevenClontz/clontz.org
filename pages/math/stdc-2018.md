With the help of a couple of my students, I volunteered to provide a livestream of many talks from
this conference, with a focus on talks from the set-theoretic topology
special session and plenary talks. Speakers from the special session and plenary speakers
not included below requested not to be recorded.

Visit <http://www.auburn.edu/~kuperkm/STDC2018/> for more information, including abstracts.

Since several people have expressed an interest in duplicating my efforts for future
topology research events, let me point you to [Online Streaming in Mathematics](/math/osm/),
my resource for supporting such events. Short version: you probably already have access to
a video camera and a sufficiently powerful laptop, so you just need to get the cables to connect
them, some free open-source software, and a couple students to press the few buttons necessary
to start/stop the stream.
