## Why OSM?

Cutting-edge research in mathematics happens faster than peer-reviewed
publication. Thankfully, tools like the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)
allow us to share initial written reports with colleagues, even
as the results are refined, edited, and refereed.

But another major way we propogate our findings are in oral presenatations.
These talks, given anywhere from university seminars to international meetings,
are an excellent opportunity to inspire others to read our full articles,
ask useful questions, and collaborate on new ideas. Unlike a paper, a talk
gives us the opportunity to encapsulate complex ideas into an intuitive
explanations. 

But attending a talk is much more involved than downloading a PDF. Faculty
and students fortunate to be located physically nearby a seminar or
conference have an extra advantage to attend, as do professors with
funding to support airfare and lodging. We always request our funding
organizations to support young researchers to attend important conferences,
but often the promised amount is insufficient to even cover lodging,
much less airfare.

I think livestreaming more of our oral presentations in mathematics
is part of the solution to this inequity, which is why I've put together
this page to explain how surprisingly easy it is to livestream mathematical 
content 
(you probably have most of the equipment available in your department already), 
and the 
[Online Streaming in Mathematics YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfaU4ITYd-mwolEox3SxvWw)
to host the streams and archives for talks given in my research community.

I want to thank the organizers of the 
[2018 Spring Topology/Dynamics Confernece](http://www.auburn.edu/~kuperkm/STDC2018/)
and its set-theoretic topology special session
for accepting my offer to livestream much of the conference procedings.
While I've been working on this initiative since my last year of graduate
school, much of the content of this page is based on that experience.

## Equipment

By design, I've focused on equipment that is often already available to
faculty whenever possible, as well as a configuration that is easiest to
implement with minimal disruption to usual conference proceedings.

These are the items you'll want to acquire for each *simultaneous* stream
you wish to produce.

- Video Camera
    - Required features:
        - Mountable on tripod (see below)
        - 720p video, decent sound recording using internal microphone
        - HDMI output (including cable)
        - Able to output video through HDMI without recording
          (tip: disable "demo mode")
    - Confirmed models:
        - TODO
- Tripod
    - Required features:
        - Can mount video camera stabily at various heights
        - Allows panning of camera to track speaker movement
    - Confirmed models:
        - TODO
- HDMI-USB Converter
    - Required features:
        - Converts HDMI audio/video signal into USB signal for use on computer
        - USB 3.0 cable (available separately)
    - Confirmed models:
        - TODO
- Laptop
    - Required features:
        - Windows, Mac, or Linux
        - Sufficient processing power for running software described below 
          (8GB RAM, 2.6 GHz processor using Windows 10 
          confirmed, but probably not necessary)
        - USB ports (3.0, perhaps using USB hub)  
          for video input and other accessories e.g. mouse
    - Confirmed models: 
        - TODO
- Other equipment
    - Long power extension cable and/or power strip
    - USB flash drive
