## Why OSM?

Cutting-edge research in mathematics happens faster than peer-reviewed
publication. Thankfully, tools like the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)
allow us to share initial written reports with colleagues, even
as the results are refined, edited, and refereed.

But another major way we propogate our findings are in oral presenatations.
These talks, given anywhere from university seminars to international meetings,
are an excellent opportunity to inspire others to read our full articles,
ask useful questions, and collaborate on new ideas. Unlike a paper, a talk
gives us the opportunity to encapsulate complex ideas into an intuitive
explanations. 

But attending a talk is much more involved than downloading a PDF. Faculty
and students fortunate to be located physically nearby a seminar or
conference have an extra advantage to attend, as do professors with
funding to support airfare and lodging. We always request our funding
organizations to support young researchers to attend important conferences,
but often the promised amount is insufficient to even cover lodging,
much less airfare.

I think livestreaming more of our oral presentations in mathematics
is part of the solution to this inequity, which is why I've put together
this page to explain how surprisingly easy it is to livestream mathematical content 
(you probably have most of the equipment available in your department already), 
and the 
[Online Streaming in Mathematics YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfaU4ITYd-mwolEox3SxvWw)
to host the streams and archives for talks given in my research community.

I want to thank the organizers of the 
[2018 Spring Topology/Dynamics Confernece](http://www.auburn.edu/~kuperkm/STDC2018/)
and its set-theoretic topology special session
for accepting my offer to livestream much of the conference procedings.
