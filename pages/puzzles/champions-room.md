This concept is something I created when my buddy [Eric][eric] and I
were approached by [Auburn Escape Zones][aez] to create an advanced escape
room experience. So, I set about to design a game which satisfies
the following qualities:

[eric]: http://www.ericharshbarger.org
[aez]: http://auburnescapezones.com/

* The puzzles follow the puzzlehunt tradition, rather than
  your typical escape room fare. This includes more cryptic clues which
  may require longer for an epiphany than what I'd recommend for
  a traditional room,
  and more complex codes than your typical substitution ciphers.
  In short, an experience for advanced puzzlers, or escape room enthusiasts
  who are looking for a different kind of challenge.
* Generally, teams should have more than enough content to fill 60 minutes.
  So, rather than the goal of escaping in that timeframe by solving everything
  there is, teams are tasked to solve as much as they can as quickly as possible.
* The game is designed to be refreshed seasonally, about every four months.
  This means a skeleton theme and structure within which the puzzles can be
  easily replaced.
* Competition between teams is the motivating factor. Teams are scored based
  on how much they solved, and how quickly they solved.
  They should be enticed to return season after season to get their names
  on top of the public leaderboard.

*Fans of Super Mario 3D World may recall this particular challenge for advanced
players, from which I drew some inspiration. Even when I had difficulty completing
the entire course, I relished the little victories as I worked my way through.*

In addition to finding a new audience for my hunt-style puzzles, I like
this concept because it's something I'd love to play myself! For that
reason, I'm licensing the concept and this write-up under
