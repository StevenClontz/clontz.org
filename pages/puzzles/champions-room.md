This concept is something I created when my buddy [Eric][eric] and I
were approached by [Auburn Escape Zones][aez] to create an advanced escape
room experience. So, I set about to design a game which satisfies
the following qualities:

[eric]: http://www.ericharshbarger.org
[aez]: http://auburnescapezones.com/

* The puzzles follow the puzzlehunt tradition, rather than
  your typical escape room fare. This includes more cryptic clues which
  may require longer for an epiphany than what I'd recommend for
  a traditional room,
  and more complex codes than your typical substitution ciphers.
  In short, an experience for advanced puzzlers, or escape room enthusiasts
  who are looking for a different kind of challenge.
* Generally, teams should have more than enough content to fill 60 minutes.
  So, rather than the goal of escaping in that timeframe by solving everything
  there is, teams are tasked to solve as much as they can as quickly as possible.
* The game is designed to be refreshed seasonally, about every four months.
  This means a skeleton theme and structure within which the puzzles can be
  easily replaced.
* Competition between teams is the motivating factor. Teams are scored based
  on how much they solved, and how quickly they solved.
  They should be enticed to return season after season to get their names
  on top of the public leaderboard.

*Fans of __Super Mario 3D World__ may recall this particular challenge for advanced
players, from which I drew some inspiration. Even when I had difficulty completing
the entire course, I relished the little victories as I worked my way through.*

In addition to finding a new audience for my hunt-style puzzles, I like
this concept because it's something I'd love to play myself! For that
reason, I'm licensing the concept and this write-up under

If you have any comments or suggestions for improvement, please contact me

Of course, I'd be remiss if I neglected to point out the major advantage of such a
room. **Champions' rooms are designed to refresh at frequent intervals,
giving dedicated players who have exhausted your other rooms more opportunities
to play games at your business.**

# Game Overview

A **champions' room** is an escape room variant drawing inspiration from
puzzlehunts and events, such as the **MIT Mystery Hunt**, **DASH**,
**Puzzled Pint**, and
many others. It is designed to require minimal staff, and to challenge/reward
advanced escape room players.

Depending on the puzzles, a team may support anywhere from six to eight
players. Unlike an escape room, there is no mystery about "how to escape
the room". Instead, the following goals are made clear from the beginning
(perhaps explained by the GM inside the room with the players):

* The room contains seven main puzzles. Each puzzle is marked with a color:
two green, two blue, and three red. These puzzles may be found throughout the
room, and don't require too much digging to find (see *Puzzle Design* below).

* A container is bound by three chains, respectively matching the three colors:
green, blue, red. There are two breaks in the green/blue chains, and three
breaks in the red chain, which are joined by combination locks. By solving
appropriately colored puzzles, the combinations to these locks are revealed.
Note that this means that only one puzzle of each color must be solved in
order to access the contents of the container.

* A scoreboard is affixed to the wall, with several eye bolts. As players
release combination locks, they should attach the lock to the appropriate
location on the scoreboard. Game Control watches this
scoreboard, and record the time when the most recent lock was attached to it.
The seven basic colored locks are worth **ten points each**, for a total
of seventy.

* Underneath the scoreboard is a black keylock attached to another eye bolt.
In its starting position it is worth nothing, but its key is locked inside
the chained container. Unlocking and moving the black keylock to the appropriate
section of the scoreboard is worth another **ten points**.

* Also in the chained container is a white lock fixed to an eye bolt, and a
final puzzle. Solving this puzzle reveals how to release the white lock,
which is worth **twenty points** when affixed to the appropriate section of
the scoreboard.

* After **sixty minutes** have elapsed, or when all locks have been scored,
the game is over. Teams' rankings are determined first by the number of
points earned, then by the amount of time they took to score their final
lock.
    * For example, suppose Team A scored 2 green, 1 blue, 2 red, and 1 black
    lock, and Team B scored 1 green, 1 blue, 1 red, 1 black, and 1 white lock.
    Both teams earned 60 points. However, if Team B scored their final lock
    at 53 minutes, but Team A scored their final lock after only 48 minutes,
    then Team A is ranked higher than Team B (regardless of the color of
    their final locks).

# Theming

![VLR's Q Room](/img/vlr-q.jpg)  
*__Virtue's Last Reward__ featured its own sort of champions' room. The
protagonist arrives in a rather plain room, which serves to test the player
on the skills they've developed throughout the game. (Among all the spoilers
which exist for VLR, this is by far the least important, so don't worry.)*

Unlike traditional escape rooms, a champions' room serves to test the
puzzling skills of its players, rather than providing an immersive alternate
reality experience. That said, there's no harm (and likely some good) in
employing a light theme to join the puzzle elements together.
At [Auburn Escape Zones][aez], we've employed a theme called
*The Puzzlemaster's Workshop*. Players interact with a maker's workspace,
complete with posters of common codes, but any puzzle type can be inserted
into the space. That way, any kind of puzzle may be easily fit to the theme,
making it easy to create new content for new seasons.

# Puzzle Design

The puzzles in a champions' room are distinct from escape room puzzles.
Because there are so few, and because they are available from the beginning
of the game in parallel, they have the latitude to be deeper than you can
achieve in a serial escape room. As mentioned before, puzzle concepts that you
may encounter in a Puzzled Pint event or early in a DASH hunt are fair game.

As a rule of thumb, you *don't* want most teams to solve all the puzzles,
although they should solve many. I use the following system to determine
the average length of a puzzle, assuming that players will attack puzzles
in pairs: (TODO: complete)

<!--
\\[
  \\frac{1}{8 puzzles} \\times 75 minutes \\times \\frac{1}{2}(\\# MaxPlayers)
\\]

In particular, in a room which supports 8 maximum players, the average puzzle
should actually take roughly 37 minutes when solved by a pair of
players. However, this should indeed
be the average. While players should not be told this explicitly, the
colors are chosen to represent difficulty: green puzzles are easy,
blue puzzles are medium, red puzzles are hard, and the white puzzle
is expert-level. So for eight players, green puzzles may be designed to last
15 minutes, blue puzzles 25 minutes, red puzzles 50 minutes, and the
white puzzle might take most players over an hour.
