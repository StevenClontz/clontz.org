## Overview

**Auburn Puzzle Party 11: Potluck VI** will be run on a Saturday in
July 2016 to be determined and at a location to be determined.\*

We will adopt a potluck format modified from the first four potlucks,
so teams can now choose to
participate as **Designer Teams** or **Solver Teams**. Designer Teams will
provide the puzzles, but every team will get to solve every puzzle brought
by another team.

## Rules

* Teams are comprised of one or two people.

* (TODO organizer team) <!-- The organizer's team will submit a puzzle and will play all the puzzles present along with the other teams, but will not be eligible for points so that there is a more or less impartial judge in the event one is needed. -->

### Designing Puzzles

* Each Designer Team must design one or two original puzzles. These puzzles
MUST be completed one week in advance of the event. The event will have to be
canceled unless the Designer Teams pull through!

* Teams should provide enough copies of their puzzle(s) for every other
Team to solve.

* Puzzles can be of any type (creativity is encouraged!)
but should be designed within 30 minutes. All necessary material to solve a
puzzle should be provided by the designing team, aside from the
materials all teams are required to bring (listed below).

* Puzzles must provide a mechanism for recording a solution, which is
scored "all-or-nothing". (TODO: master solution sheet?)

* Puzzles must not require players to leave the event venue in order to be
solved.

### Playing the Game

* (TODO materials to bring)

* (TODO stations)<!-- The Potluck consists of one station per puzzle (Station 1, Station 2, etc.), plus a Timekeeper Station, and one 30 minute Round per team. Teams begin at the Station number equal to their team number plus one, looping back to the Timekeeper Station. (Team 1 starts at Station 2, Team 2 starts at Station 3, and the highest-numbered Team starts at the Timekeeper Station.) Each Team leaves a copy of their puzzle at the Station matching their own number. During each Round, each Team solves the puzzle at their Station before the 30 minutes elapses. The Team at the Timekeeper Station is responsible for timing the 30 minutes for the Round and giving warnings at 20, 10, and 5 minutes. -->

* (TODO scoring) <!-- There will be a few minutes between Rounds for each Team to evaluate and reset the puzzle at their Station. Results should be recorded on the Team Scoresheet. -->

* (TODO rotations) <!-- Each consecutive Round, Teams progress to the next numbered Station, looping from the final Station to the Timekeeper Station. -->

### How to Win

* (TODO wrapup) <!-- After all of the Rounds are completed, Teams will gather to explain their puzzles and solutions in order. After these explanations, teams will fill out and turn in their Puzzle Ranking Sheets. Points will be scaled linearly so that each team awards the same number of points total to their opponents. -->

* (TODO winners) <!-- Finally, each Team will turn in their Team Scoresheet and Puzzle Ranking Sheet to the organizer, who will tabulate the scores and announce the winners. -->

## Registered Teams

Registration is not yet open (hey, we don't even have a date yet). After
it is, the teams will be listed here.

* **Designer Teams**  
  (must design puzzles before *TBD*)
    * *(none)*
* **Solver Teams**
    * *(none)*

\*On the numbering...
Potluck VI will be the eleventh major Auburn puzzle community event,
not counting [Eric's Puzzle Parties][epp], so I thought I'd go with it.
Besides, word on the street tells me
there's going to be a full-fledged puzzlehunt called Auburn Puzzle
Party 12!
(I won't be organizing, but I bet you'll be hearing more about that soon.)
