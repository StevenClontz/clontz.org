Our last [puzzle potluck][0]
ran over a year ago. It's about time.

## Overview

**Auburn Puzzle Party 11: Potluck VI** will be run on a Saturday in
July 2016 to be determined and at a location to be determined.\*

We will adopt a potluck format modified from the first four potlucks,
so teams can now choose to
participate as **Designer Teams** or **Solver Teams**. Designer Teams will
provide the puzzles, but every team will get to solve every puzzle brought
by another team.

## Rules

**Consider the below rules as unofficial, pending feedback. Email me
at <steven.clontz@gmail.com> if you have thoughts.**

* Teams are composed of one or two people.

* The organizer will provide two puzzles exclusively for Designer Teams to
  complete in place of their own puzzle(s). Solver Teams can try these puzzles
  after the event at their leisure. The organizer will serve as impartial judge
  if necessary, but these things tend to run themselves. :-)

### Designing Puzzles

* Each Designer Team must design one or two original puzzles. The team
  designates how many puzzles they will provide at registration. **These puzzles
  MUST be completed one week in advance of the event.** When a puzzle has
  been finalized, the team should email the organizer with its solution.
  The event will have to be
  canceled unless the Designer Teams pull through!

* Designer Teams only need to create one copy of each puzzle they contribute,
  except for any consumable elements which must be reset for each team.

* Puzzles can be of any type (creativity is encouraged!)
  but should be designed to be solved within 30 minutes.
  All necessary material to solve a
  puzzle should be provided by the designing team, aside from the
  materials all teams are required to bring (listed below).

* **Puzzles must solve to a word, phrase, number, or otherwise some sequence of
  letters and/or numbers.** The organizer will provide
  a solution sheet with blank spaces for each team to write their guesses
  for all puzzle solutions.

* Puzzles must not require players to leave the event venue in order to be
  solved.

### Playing the Game

* All teams should bring **paper** (as a notebook, or perhaps on a clipboard)
  and uncolored **pens/pencils**. Any other required
  supplies will be provided by the Designer Teams for their own puzzle(s).

* The potluck consists of at least one station per puzzle. Teams begin at the
  station matching their number (which may or may not feature one of their own
  puzzles). During each round, teams have 30 minutes
  to solve the puzzle at their station. (If a Designer Team is at a station
  with their own puzzle, they will solve a puzzle provided by the organizer
  instead.)

* Solutions must be written on the provided solution sheet
  and kept with the team until the end of the game; solutions may not be
  changed/added after the 30 minutes for that puzzle have expired.

* The organizer will keep the official time. After each puzzle, teams will
  have a brief period to reset their puzzle(s)
  and rotate to the next numbered station (or back to
  station 1 from the highest numbered station) before the organizer
  starts the next 30 minutes.

* At the end of competition, the organizer will collect solution sheets from
  all teams to grade.

* The organizer will distribute surveys asking each team about each puzzle
  (besides the organizer's, which are ineligible for awards). Each
  Designer Team will be given two minutes to describe how they intended their
  puzzle to be solved, its solution, and any other
  relevant information. The organizer will grade the solution sheets during
  this time.

### How to Win

* Designer Teams are eligible for the **Designers' Trophy**. Each team
  will complete a survey on all the other puzzles they completed, simply
  ranking each on a scale of 1 to 5 stars (with half-stars allowed). The
  Design Points for a puzzle are given by the average number of stars it
  receives from this survey multiplied by two and rounded to the nearest
  integer.
  The Designer Team which contributed the puzzle with the
  most Design Points wins the trophy.

* All Teams are eligible for the **Potluck Trophy**, although Designer Teams
  will have an advantage. The team earning the most Potluck Points as described
  below will win this trophy.
    * 10 Potluck Points are awarded for solving another team's puzzle
    * A maximum of 20 Potluck Points are awarded to Designer Teams for each
      puzzle they contribute. This is calculated by the formula
      \\((1-\\left|\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{Solves}{Teams}\\right|)\\times Bonus \\times 10\\),
      where Teams is the number of opposing teams, Solves is the number of
      opposing teams who solved the puzzle, and Bonus is 2 if your team solved the
      organizer's substitute puzzle and 1 otherwise.

* Solver Teams are eligible for the **Solvers' Trophy** based upon their
  Potluck Points.

* In the case of a tie for any trophy, the sum of Design Points and Potluck
  Points will be used to break the tie.
  (Note this gives an advantage to Designer Teams.) If this does not break the
  tie, then the remaining tied teams will be asked a toss-up puzzle with a
  numerical answer, and the team closest to the correct answer wins.

## Registered Teams

Registration is not yet open (hey, we don't even have a date yet). After
it is, the teams will be listed here. Note that availability for Solver Teams
is limited by the number of Designer Teams contributing two puzzles.

* **Designer Teams**  
  (must design puzzles before *TBD*)
    * *(none)*
* **Solver Teams (currently available: 0)**
    * *(none)*

\*On the numbering...
Potluck VI will be the eleventh major Auburn puzzle community event,
not counting [Eric's Puzzle Parties][epp], so I thought I'd go with it.
Besides, word on the street tells me
there's going to be a full-fledged puzzlehunt called Auburn Puzzle
Party 12!
(I won't be organizing, but I bet you'll be hearing more about that soon.)
