## About my Teaching

I love teaching! I trace this enthusiasm back to
a decade serving as a National Youth Leadership Training
staffer at Camp Westmoreland in the BSA's Greater Alabama Council.
NYLT utilizes youth instructors for teaching all courses, giving my
teenaged self the opportunity to educate my peers on how to be
better leaders and teachers. Years later I used those skills as
I served as an instructor of mathematics at several institutions of
higher education.
