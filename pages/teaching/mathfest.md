I will be co-organizing two workshops and giving
one individual presentation at MAA MathFest 2018.
Please contact me at <sclontz@southalabama.edu> with any questions!

Participants are encouraged to review the following "readiness preparation materials" 
(a component of Team-Based Learning), to introduce them to the basic
ideas behind Team-Based Learning.

Time estimates calculated using [Niram.org](http://niram.org/read/).

## Workshop: Mathematical Puzzle Programs: Outreach and Recruitment with Puzzles

Participants in this workshop will get to play an abbreviated version of the
MaPP Challenge competition for themselves. If possible, please bring
an iOS or Android smart device with internet access to play along using
the [ClueKeeper](http://cluekeeper.com) app.

Please visit [MaPPmath.org](http://mappmath.org) for more information
