Aside from the math intrinsic in [puzzling](/puzzles/) and
[programming](/code/), I am a published researcher in
set-theoretic topology. My specializations include applications
of game theory in topology as well as the study of generalized
inverse limits.

## My publications

An overview of my work in mathematics may be found on my
[ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Steven_Clontz).

## Research Statement

An updated statement on my research is available with my
[CV on GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz/cv).
