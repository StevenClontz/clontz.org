I"µ<p>A project that had been almost as long overdue as reviving <a href="http://www.stevenclontz.com">http://www.stevenclontz.com</a> was updating my neglected resume.</p>

<p>The tl;dr version: check it out at <a href="http://resume.stevenclontz.com">http://resume.stevenclontz.com</a>! But if you think that looks nice and would like to check out the web app that powers it, please read on. :-)</p>

<p>I knew I wanted my resume to be web-first. The last time I wrote a resume (back in early 2011) I had TeX‚Äôd it up locally. And hey, at least that‚Äôs better than a Word document, right? However, and maybe I‚Äôve gotten lazier in the past two years‚Ä¶ but trudging through this didn‚Äôt seem appealing:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>\begin{ressection}{Education}
    \begin{ressubsec}{Auburn University}{Auburn, AL}{Bachelor's of Science and Master of Science in Mathematics}
        \ressubitem{Undergraduate GPA: 3.88 (overall), 4.00 (Major)}
        \ressubitem{Undergraduate Graduation Date: May, 2008 (Summa Cum Laude, University Honors Scholar)}
        \ressubitem{Masters GPA: 4.00}
        \ressubitem{Masters Graduation Date: December, 2010}
        \ressubitem{Currently pursuing Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Auburn}
    \end{ressubsec}
\end{ressection}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So began my search for a simpler way. My first instinct was <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> - it‚Äôs what <a href="http://www.teloga.com">Teloga</a> uses, it‚Äôs what <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> uses, heck, it‚Äôs what this blog uses. And certainly this markup is a lot friendlier to read and edit:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>##Education

####Auburn University - Auburn, AL

* Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics (2008)
    * 3.9 overall GPA | 4.0 major GPA
    * Summa Cum Laude | University Honors Scholar | Phi Kappa Phi | Phi Beta Kappa
    * Honors thesis in unfoldings of convex polyhedra | Undergraduate Research Fellow
* Master of Science in Mathematics (2010)
    * 4.0 GPA
    * Master thesis in linearly ordered topological spaces
* Doctoral Candidate in Mathematics
    * Currently writing dissertation on limited information strategies in topological games
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So I thought the simple thing to do would be to just make a page on this blog for the resume. And when I did, it didn‚Äôt look half bad either.</p>

<p>The only problem‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd probably need a PDF version as well, and maybe even have to print it at some point. Silly old media.</p>

<p>Now, keeping multiple copies of the same resume definitely violates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>; I wanted a slicker solution. So my first idea was to just print the webpage from Chrome and save it as a PDF.</p>

<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>So, the issue that Octopress‚Äôs default theme doesn‚Äôt have a nice print stylesheet is a topic for another day, but I figured there was someone else out there of a similar mind that would have already paved the way for a nice way to share a resume written in Markdown.</p>

<p>As it often does, the Google helped me find an answer earlier today: <a href="http://pseudoweb.net/2010/10/25/developing-your-resume/">http://pseudoweb.net/2010/10/25/developing-your-resume/</a></p>

<p>Looks nice, and it prints well too. Incidentally, Mr. Welch‚Äôs resume app makes use of this very cool Ruby gem called <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> which I may need to look more into for simple apps. I‚Äôm new to Ruby (hey maybe I can add it to my resume now though) but hacking his app to do what I wanted was pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>I added a few extra variables to the configuration YAML to store the URL of the page itself and the URL of a QR Code image leading to that URL, which I use in a couple of nice extra features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>If the page is printed, it adds a line to the top: ‚ÄúOptimized for web</td>
          <td>http://resume_url‚Äù</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>A QR code floats in the upper right of the page, also linking to the digital version of the resume.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can see it in action at <a href="http://resume.stevenclontz.com">my resume page</a>, and my forked version of the app can be found <a href="https://github.com/StevenClontz/Resume">on my Github</a>.</p>

<p>There are still a couple of tweaks that might be nice to have if I decide to work on this more later.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôd be preferable to have a script to burn a PDF from the resume.md Markdown file rather than using a browser printout, possibly leveraging LaTeX.</li>
  <li>A simple change would be to move some of the basic data (name, address, etc.) into the configuration file to standardize the header.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the meantime, I hope you found all this interesting, and maybe I‚Äôve inspired you to use revision control and Markdown to maintain your own resume!</p>
