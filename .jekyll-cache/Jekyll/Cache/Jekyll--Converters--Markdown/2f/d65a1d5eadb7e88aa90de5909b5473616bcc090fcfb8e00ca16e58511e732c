<h2 id="whats-so-cool-about-puzzles">What’s so cool about puzzles?</h2>

<p>I came to puzzles as a mathematician,
because <em>mathematics is the art of solving problems</em>, and <em>puzzle design
is the art of creating fun problems to solve</em>.</p>

<h2 id="new-collaborations">New collaborations</h2>

<p>Most of my time is dedicated to <a href="/math/">research</a>, <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a>,
and running <a href="http://mappmath.org">Mathematical Puzzle Programs</a>.
However, I am always open to discussing potential new projects, particularly if
the project is novel or serves to promote mathematics. I’m always up
for talking shop by <a href="steven.clontz@gmail.com">email</a>, so send me a note
if you’re interested in working together on something!</p>

<h2 id="portfolio">Portfolio</h2>

<p>I’ve been involved in puzzling as a hobbyist and professional since 2009.
I’m particularly interested in puzzlehunts: large-scale events which involve
teams of players solving puzzles, which can end up sending them across an
entire campus or town to find the solution. I’ve also gotten involved
in escape rooms more recently, as both a designer and player.</p>

<p>A few of my projects can be found below.</p>

<h3 id="auburn-puzzle-community">Auburn Puzzle Community</h3>

<p><img src="/img/puzzlehunt-2.jpg" alt="Puzzlehunt" /></p>

<p>I played and won my first
<a href="http://app.clontz.org">Auburn Puzzle Party</a> in 2009, and
lead a team of puzzle designers to create Auburn Puzzle Parties 4 and 5 from
2010-2012. I’ve also developed multiple Auburn Puzzle Potluck concepts putting
designers in head-to-head competition.</p>

<p>I retired from competitive puzzling in Auburn in 2016. During my tenure,
I tied the community record for most first place wins, and I still hold
the longest active streak of the first place wins in Auburn community puzzlehunts.
My trophies include four
<a href="http://www.ericharshbarger.org/epp/">Eric’s Puzzle Parties</a> and
two Auburn Puzzle Parties.</p>

<h3 id="ampd-challenge">AMP’d Challenge</h3>

<p>In 2012, I teamed with fellow AU graduate student Braxton Carrigan
to create the
<a href="http://www.auburn.edu/academic/cosam/departments/outreach/programs/AMPd/index.htm">Auburn Mathematical Puzzle (AMP’d) Challenge</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ampd.jpg" alt="AMP'd Logo" /></p>

<p>Our goal was to expose mathematical topics traditionally underrepresented
in grade school classrooms to middle school students. More
importantly, we wanted to present mathematics as critical thinking and
problem solving in a fun enviornment, rather than the rote memorization
of rules and formulas. Not only that, but it was a great
way to introduce students to Auburn University’s campus, i.e. a great
recruiting tool.</p>

<p>AMP’d has been a huge success at Auburn, mostly thanks to the continued
support from current AU mathematics graduate students who
develop the game from year to year. Auburn now runs annual events for both
middle school and high school students at capacity.</p>

<h3 id="mathematical-puzzle-programs">Mathematical Puzzle Programs</h3>

<p><img src="http://mappmath.org/img/logo/banner_color.svg" alt="MaPP" /></p>

<p>Due to the ridiculous success of AMP’d at Auburn, I saw a demand
for expanding the availability for these sorts of educational experiences
across the country. To meet this demand I founded
<a href="http://mappmath.org">Mathematical Puzzle Programs (MaPP)</a>, and thanks
to the hard work of several colleagues who collaborated with me
on this venture, we launched in spring 2016 with high school puzzle
competitions at five diffrent college campuses
from Texas to Connecticut.</p>

<p>As Director of MaPP, I will double that number in 2017,
including an expansion to Japan and the introduction of a middle
school competition in partnership with the AMP’d Challenge.</p>

<h3 id="the-national-museum-of-mathematics-momath">The National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath)</h3>

<p><img src="/img/momath.png" alt="MoMath" /></p>

<p>I am a frequent consultant with the National Museum of Mathematics,
including designing MoMath’s
<a href="https://in.momath.org/civicrm/event/info?id=751">Dimensions Puzzle Hunt 2016</a>,
an annual puzzle challenge held on the museum’s campus
in New York City, and talking about game theory for their
<a href="https://in.momath.org/civicrm/event/info?id=758">Family Fridays</a>
outreach program.</p>

<h3 id="leadership-in-the-zombie-apocolypse">Leadership in the Zombie Apocolypse</h3>

<p><img src="/img/zombies.png" alt="MaPP" /></p>

<p>In partnership with <a href="http://www.theleadersfoundry.com/">The Leaders Foundry</a>
I developed a puzzle challenge
for people managers in their “Leadership in the Zombie Apocolypse”
training. The Leaders Foundry uses this
event as a final test of the skills they cover in their People
Manager Developer Program.</p>

<h3 id="escape-pod">Escape Pod</h3>

<p><img src="/img/escape-pod.png" alt="Escape Pod" /></p>

<p>I designed Von Braun’s Puzzlehunt, sponsored by <a href="http://escapepodgame.com">Escape Pod</a> of
Huntsville, AL and based on their featured escape room. This five-hour hunt
took place across the City of Huntsville during November 2016.</p>

<h3 id="escape-zones">Escape Zones</h3>

<p><img src="/img/escape-zones.png" alt="Escape Zones" /></p>

<p>I’m a regular contributer to <a href="http://www.auburnescapezones.com/">Escape Zones</a> in Auburn, AL. I’ve playtested
every room they’ve opened to the public, and I collaborated with Eric
Harshbarger on their first <a href="/puzzles/champions-room/">champions’ room</a>,
a variation on the traditional escape room format of my own design.</p>

<h3 id="puzzled-pint">Puzzled Pint</h3>

<p><img src="/img/puzzled-pint.png" alt="Puzzled Pint" /></p>

<p>I co-founded the <a href="http://twitter.com/PuzzPintHSV">Huntsville, AL chapter of Puzzled Pint</a> with
my friend and colleague Tracy Cobbs. Puzzled Pint is available in cities
world-wide, providing free puzzles at local pubs on the second Tuesday of
each month. We launched the Huntsville chapter in June 2016, and broke
the international record for attendance at a chapter’s first event.
I also designed a puzzle for Puzzled Pint’s election-themed November 2016 event.</p>

<h3 id="joco-cruise-2016">JoCo Cruise 2016</h3>

<p><img src="/img/joco.svg" alt="JoCo" /></p>

<p>I contributed an original puzzle for
the 2016 <a href="https://jococruise.com/">JoCo Cruise</a> Puzzlehunt, organized by
my friends/colleagues Charles and Erin McPillan.</p>

<h3 id="super-mario-maker">Super Mario Maker</h3>

<p><img src="/img/super-mario-maker.jpg" alt="Super Mario Maker" /></p>

<p>I’ve designed several single-screen puzzle courses for Super Mario Maker
(along with some more traditional platformers),
available on the <a href="https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/profile/StevenXC">Super Mario Maker Bookmark Site</a>. Finally,
my childhood dream of making Mario courses has come true!</p>

<h3 id="zero-time-dilemma">Zero Time Dilemma</h3>

<p><img src="/img/20160705/fragment.jpg" alt="Zero Time Dilemma" /></p>

<p>I wrote a detailed <a href="/blog/2016/07/05/zero-time-dilemma/">spoiler-free guide</a> for progressing the
narrative of the visual novel Zero Time Dilemma. I like to think of it as the
hint system the designers should have included in the game.</p>
