I"ç<p>Too many web development posts! Time for some topology!</p>

<p>As an exercise I‚Äôve worked through the classical result that if a space <script type="math/tex">X</script>
is compact Hausdorff and has a <script type="math/tex">G_\delta</script>-diagonal <script type="math/tex">\Delta</script>, then <script type="math/tex">X</script> is
metrizable.
It relies on Urysohn‚Äôs theorem that regular second-countable spaces are
metrizable, and since compact Hausdorff spaces are normal*, I‚Äôll just show
that the space is second countable.</p>

<p>When I went to compare, most of proofs I found online and in texts like
Engleking were a lot less direct (involving characterizations
of <script type="math/tex">G_\delta</script> diagonals using covers), so I hope someone gets
some use out of this fairly straight-forward attack (due to a hint from
my advisor Gary Gruenhage).</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

<p>We‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre good on most of the terms, but <script type="math/tex">G_\delta</script> sets are
countable intersections (from the <script type="math/tex">\delta</script>) of open sets (from the <script type="math/tex">G</script>). The
diagonal of a space is what you expect:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Delta = \{\langle x,x \rangle : x \in X \} \subseteq X^2</script>

<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>

<p>Start by assuming that <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\Delta = \bigcap_{n<\omega} G_n %]]></script> where
<script type="math/tex">G_{n+1} \subseteq G_n</script>. Since <script type="math/tex">X^2</script> is normal (not because <script type="math/tex">X</script> is, but
because <script type="math/tex">X^2</script> is also compact Hausdorff) and <script type="math/tex">\Delta</script> is closed, we can set
<script type="math/tex">U_0=G_0</script>, and
<script type="math/tex">\Delta \subseteq U_{n+1} \subseteq \overline{U_{n+1}}\subseteq U_n \cap G_{n+1}</script>.</p>

<p>It follows that
<script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\Delta \subseteq \bigcap_{n<\omega} U_n \subseteq \bigcap_{n<\omega} \overline{U_n} \subseteq \bigcap_{n<\omega} G_n = \Delta %]]></script></p>

<p>These <script type="math/tex">U_n</script> have a special property: for every <script type="math/tex">x\in X</script> and every open
neighborhood <script type="math/tex">A</script> of <script type="math/tex">x</script>, there is some <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
n<\omega %]]></script> such that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">U_n[x]=\{y:\langle x,y\rangle \in U_n\}\subseteq A</script>

<p>To see this, suppose not: then we may choose <script type="math/tex">x_n \in U_n[x]\setminus A</script>.
Since <script type="math/tex">x_n \in \overline{U_m[x]}</script> for <script type="math/tex">n\geq m</script>, it follows that <script type="math/tex">x_n</script> must
converge in <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\bigcap_{m<\omega} \overline{U_m[x]} = \{x\} %]]></script>. But since <script type="math/tex">x_n</script>
converges to <script type="math/tex">x</script>, its neighborhood <script type="math/tex">A</script> must contain all but finitely many
<script type="math/tex">x_n</script>, a contradiction.</p>

<p>Now, since <script type="math/tex">U_n</script> is open, we can choose open <script type="math/tex">B_{x,n}</script> for each <script type="math/tex">x\in X</script> such
that  <script type="math/tex">(B_{x,n})^2\subseteq U_n</script>. Since <script type="math/tex">X</script> is compact, let <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}_n</script>
be a finite subcover for <script type="math/tex">\{B_{x,n}: x\in X\}</script> for each <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
n<\omega %]]></script>.</p>

<p>We note that <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\mathcal{B} = \bigcup_{n<\omega} \mathcal{B}_n %]]></script> is countable,
and we claim it is a base for <script type="math/tex">X</script>. Let <script type="math/tex">A</script> be a neighborhood of <script type="math/tex">x</script>; then
choose <script type="math/tex">U_n</script> such that <script type="math/tex">U_n[x]\subseteq A</script>. We need only take <script type="math/tex">B_{z,n}</script> from
the cover <script type="math/tex">\mathcal{B}_n</script> of <script type="math/tex">X</script> such that <script type="math/tex">x\in B_{z,n}</script>, and note that
<script type="math/tex">(B_{z,n})^2\subseteq U_n</script> implies <script type="math/tex">x\in B_{z,n}\subseteq U_n[x] \subseteq A</script>.
<script type="math/tex">\Box</script></p>

  *Not too bad: you can easily show that in Hausdorff spaces, not just
  points can be separated by open sets, but all compact sets can be
  separated by open sets. All closed subsets of compact spaces are compact,
  so that‚Äôs that.
