I"ë<p>Another semester of <a href="/teaching/">teaching</a> has begun! Iâ€™m teaching
two sections of Calculus 2 at my new university: The University of
South Alabama.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve flipped the classroom this semester, so students will watch
YouTube lectures posted to that site, and then work on problems in
the classroom with me and their classmates.</p>
