I"<p>My team won <a href="http://www.ericharshbarger.org/epp/2014/">EPP14</a>!</p>

<p>I added a <a href="https://github.com/StevenClontz/epp14">GitHub repository</a>
which has the code I wrote to tackle three of the puzzles, but the most fun
I had was surprising not the mathematics and coding.</p>

<p>Nope, it was playing <em>Adventure</em> for the Atari 2600.</p>

<p>The Easter Egg-themed puzzlehunt was capped off by an old-school hidden
puzzle. I was very fortunate to be on a team with several other talented
puzzlers, since I wouldn’t have cracked the code that got me to the
Atari joystick. But once there, I managed to uncover the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_%281979_video_game%29#Easter_egg">first video game Easter Egg</a>
in just over 17 minutes. Normal puzzles were worth 100 points, but this
hidden puzzle was worth up to 300 points, minus 3 points per minute
expired in finding the egg, scoring us 249 points.</p>

<p>It almost made up for the 200-300 points we destroyed by dropping our
egg in the Egg Toss earlier that day. :-)</p>

<p>Again, check out my <a href="https://github.com/StevenClontz/epp14">GitHub</a> to
learn more about the coding I did to solve a few puzzles, and I’m sure Eric
will update his <a href="http://www.ericharshbarger.org/epp/2014/">EPP14 page</a>
with more information on the party and puzzles after a well-deserved rest.
Here’s to another great game, Mr. Harshbarger!</p>
