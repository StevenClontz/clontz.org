I"8<p>Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out my new blog*. After deciding I didn’t need to waste so much cash on domain names I don’t use and web space I barely needed, I took down stevenclontz.com along with most of my other old PHP/Wordpress sites. I’ll get stevenclontz.com to point here sometime soon.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://jdabbs.com">James Dabbs</a> for showing <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> to me the other day - a blogging system with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> revision control and hosting by <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> sounds alright to me.</p>

<p>I’ll be working on my <a href="/about/">About</a> page and getting my <a href="http://resume.stevenclontz.com">Resume</a> up to date over the coming days.  Email me at <a href="mailto:steven.clontz@gmail.com">steven.clontz@gmail.com</a> if you need to get in touch with me! See ya.</p>

<p>-SXC</p>

<p><small>*Is this sentence obligatory for a first blog post? I almost always see it, and it sounded awkward not to include it. Thanks again I guess. :-)</small></p>
