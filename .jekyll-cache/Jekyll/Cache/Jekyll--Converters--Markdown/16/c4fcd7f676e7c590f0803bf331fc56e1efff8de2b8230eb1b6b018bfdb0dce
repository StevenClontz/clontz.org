I"G<p>So here’s an arrangement by myself (Steven Clontz, alias Steben on the Overclocked ReMix forums) of the Katamari Damacy theme, Katamari on the Rocks, for marching band. The percussion was arranged by Christopher Nelson (alias Rainman DX on the Overclocked ReMix forums). This was written somewhere around 2006, when I was a student at Auburn University (hence why I stuck a bit of “War Eagle” in the arrangement).</p>

<p>Over the last decade I’d get requests for the arrangement every couple years or so, but somewhere down the road I had misplaced the hard drive that contained them. Fortunately, I recently had the presence of mind to track down Chris, who had kept up with his copies better than I.</p>

<p>The arrangement’s Finale source files and a burned MP3 of the resulting MIDI have been stored in the following GitHub repo for posterity.</p>

<p>Here’s a direct link to the MP3 if you want to give it a listen.</p>
