<h2 id="typesetting-professional-documents-with-overleafsharelatex">Typesetting Professional Documents with Overleaf/ShareLaTeX</h2>

<p>Something you can start doing now, no matter how far off your job hunt is,
is learn to typeset professional documents. In addition to writing research
papers, itâ€™s good practice to use professional-looking templates based on the
LaTeX typesetting system. Learning LaTeX isnâ€™t hard, especially if you use
cloud LaTeX services like <a href="http://overleaf.com">Overleaf</a> and <a href="http://sharelatex.com">ShareLaTeX</a>.</p>

<p>Both websites allow you to select pre-made templates for CVs, cover letters,
and so on. You can then open up the LaTeX code within your web browser,
make your edits to customize its contents to yourself, and then save/share the
result online or download a PDF. First impressions are important, and using
LaTeX to typeset documents is the industry standard, so itâ€™s wise to use it when
presenting yourself to prospective future collegues.</p>

<h2 id="networking-in-real-life-and-online">Networking in real life and online</h2>

<p>Your main goal as an applicant is to get your foot in the door. In a sea of
qualified applicants, you only have a few opporunities to catch a search committeeâ€™s
attention. One important way is to have a colleague at the school youâ€™re applying to.
That means that as soon as you have research to share, you need to start going to
conferences and meeting people in your field.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a very small chance that youâ€™ll
know someone on the search committee. Howeer, many search committees will ask their
colleagues for input. Those collegues will probably (at most) look through the list of
applicant names, their schools, and their fields. So, you want your name to be familiar
to that colleague, at least enough that they will take the extra step to read your cover 
letter.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no substitute for meeting colleagues in real life. However, another tool you 
can use to follow up on a real life connection is <a href="http://researchgate.net">ResearchGate</a>. While
search committees should read every cover letter they receive, your colleague may not
be serving on that committee. In that case, they may only have a list of names,
schools, and fields of research; thus, you want to increase your chances of name
recognition.</p>

<h2 id="finding-jobs-and-submitting-applications">Finding jobs and submitting applications</h2>

<p>While there are other sites for academic mathematics jobs, the only one I used during
my search was <a href="http://mathjobs.org">MathJobs</a>. You should begin looking on this site 13 months
before you want to start; for example, if youâ€™re looking for a job to start in August
2018, you should begin looking in July 2017.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s my recommended workflow. Start by making an account. Once youâ€™ve logged in,
go through all the job postings by clicking All on the View Jobs page. Youâ€™ll
probably notice that 80% of the postings donâ€™t apply to you, depending on your
field of research and geographical preferences. Mark those jobs with an X so they
will be hidden by default when logged in. Other jobs you will know that you want
to apply. Mark those with a checkmark.</p>

<p>Now once youâ€™ve filtered all the postings, you can click the yellow jagged cloud
on future logins to see whatâ€™s been posted since the last time you visited. I
recommend doing this once a week so you donâ€™t get overwhelmed.</p>

<p>There are other places for advice on how to write CVs, cover letters, etc.,
beyond my general advice above on using professional LaTeX typesetting.
One particular thing Iâ€™d like to mention: make sure you make the case in your
cover letter for why you want that job particularly. A connection with
a faculty member or the local community is a great way to catch the attention
of search committees you have a particular interest in.</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
