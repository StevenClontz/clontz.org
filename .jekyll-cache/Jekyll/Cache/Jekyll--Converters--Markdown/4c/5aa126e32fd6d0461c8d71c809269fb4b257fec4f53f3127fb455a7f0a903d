I"<p>The majority of this presentation is anticipated to be a demonstration
of various tools I use or have created for mastery grading, but
here are a few notes that I‚Äôll be using during my talk.</p>

<p>Credit goes to Dr. Drew Lewis who provided his slides on
‚ÄúStandards Based and Specifciations Grading‚Äù which inspired some
of this talk.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am more interested in what students learn than when they learn it or how many tries it takes them to learn it.</li>
  <li>Students are not all like me. They are wonderfully diverse in so many ways.</li>
  <li>Any single assessment is not a valid measure of learning.</li>
  <li>Learning takes time and involves mistakes.</li>
  <li>Grades should represent eventual understanding rather than speed/time required.</li>
  <li>We learn more from failure than success. So providing opportunities to fail without penalty (and therefore incentives to try despite the fear of failure) is critical to an effective grading system.</li>
  <li>Conversations with students are best when they are about math or tacos.</li>
  <li>Misconceptions snowball; don‚Äôt let them take root.</li>
  <li>The grading structure of the class should help motivate student learning.</li>
  <li>Learning comes from mistakes.</li>
  <li>The incentive structure of grades should encourage good learning behaviors.</li>
  <li>Final grades should be as pure a function of student learning as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-mastery-grading">What is Mastery Grading?</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.masterygrading.com/">https://www.masterygrading.com/</a>‚Ä¶</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mastery grading is an approach to student assessment in which student work is graded 
directly on whether it demonstrates mastery of a clear list of objectives.</li>
  <li>Rather than using points or partial credit, final grades are based on the degree of 
mastery each student has demonstrated of the objectives by the end of the course.</li>
  <li>Students typically have (or can earn) multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery of 
each objective.</li>
  <li>Mastery grading puts emphasis on learning, provides clarity for students, and 
encourages perseverance and <strong>growth mindset</strong> (emphasis mine).</li>
</ul>
