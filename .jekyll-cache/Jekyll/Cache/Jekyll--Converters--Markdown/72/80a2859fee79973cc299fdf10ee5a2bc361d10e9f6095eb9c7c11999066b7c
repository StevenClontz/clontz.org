I"Ë<p>Since I recently relaunched my <a href="http://gradecalc.stevenclontz.com">grade calculator website</a> I wanted to see how the month of finals affected my traffic.</p>

<p>Basically, over a 1000 daily visits around the week before Christmas, compared to fifteen total concerned students on Christmas day.</p>

<p>While these stats arenâ€™t surprising, I suppose itâ€™s a nice confirmation that my analytics software passes the eyeball test for realistic statistics. When I moved off of auburn.edu I took a major hit in my Google ranking however - itâ€™d be interesting to have statistics from a year ago (I unfortunately did not have my tracking code up and running).</p>
