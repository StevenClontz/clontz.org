I"É<p>As usual, since I spent some time writing this up on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/">/r/learnmath</a>, Iâ€™d like to share it with you guys. The OP asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what does it mean to raise a number to the power of i?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I explain in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/1tuq9y/what_does_it_mean_to_raise_a_number_to_the_power/cebqmng">this comment</a>, but here it is too.</p>

<p>Alright, so, weâ€™re talking about complex numbers, so Iâ€™m assuming you know how to plot them in the complex plane and do basic addition/multiplication.</p>

<p>If we want to know what a number like $2^3$ means, itâ€™s pretty easy: you take $2Ã—2Ã—2=8$. Same for $(-3i)^3$ <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28-3i%29%5E3">(Wolfram Alpha)</a>: itâ€™s $-3i\times -3i\times -3i=-27i$.</p>

<p>Think about whatâ€™s happening visually: $2^3$ stretches the vector from the origin which used to point to $2+0i$, but now it points to $8+0i$. The effect on $(-3i)^3$ is more complicated: thereâ€™s stretching, <em>and</em> reflection across the origin.</p>

<p>When you mix the two together, say, $(2-3i)^3$ <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282-3i%29%5E3">(Wolfram Alpha)</a> which is equal to $-46-9i$, you get stretching, and a reflection across the imaginary axis.</p>

<p>So, hereâ€™s where the usefulness of raising a number to an imaginary (or complex) number kicks in: it gets us arbitrary rotations. It just so happens that multiplying a complex number by $e^{\theta i}$ rotates that number $\theta$ radians counter-clockwise around the origin. For example, $3e^{\frac{\pi}{2}i}$ <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3e%5E%7B%5Cpi%2F2+i%7D">(Wolfram Alpha)</a> is $3i$ since that represents a rotation of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ or $90$ degrees.</p>

<p>You can take any complex number of the form $(a+bi)^i$ and manipulate it to be in the form $(c+di)e^{\theta i}$ (although thatâ€™s out of the scope of this post). For example: $(1+i)^i$ <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281%2Bi%29%5Ei">(Wolfram Alpha)</a> can be manipulated to become $e^{\frac{\pi}{4}}2^{\frac{1}{2}i}$, which can be rewritten as $e^{\frac{\pi}{4}}e^{\ln(\sqrt{2})i}$ . So weâ€™re taking the point $e^{\frac{\pi}{4}}+0i$, and rotating it $\ln(\sqrt{2})$ (about $0.34$ or $\frac{\pi}{9}$) radians around the origin.</p>

<p>Since $(a+bi)^{c+di} = (a+bi)^c(a+bi)^{di}$, we see that raising a complex number to a complex number represents a certain exponential stretch or compression from the origin, followed by a certain rotation.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: You can write $(a+bi)^{c+di}$ to be of the form $(x+yi)e^{\theta i}$, which means take the complex point $x+yi$ and rotate it $\theta$ radians counter-clockwise around the origin of the complex plane.</strong></p>

<p>(Apologies for the rawness of the explanationâ€¦ Iâ€™d really like to clean this up down the road and put in some pictures. Hope someone thinks itâ€™s useful, though!)</p>
