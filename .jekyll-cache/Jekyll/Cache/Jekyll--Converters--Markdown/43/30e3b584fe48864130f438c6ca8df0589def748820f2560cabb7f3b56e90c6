I"l<p>A lotâ€™s gone on since the last time I updated the site.
I took a visiting position at <a href="http://uncc.edu">UNC Charlotte</a>,
founded <a href="http://mappmath.org">Mathematical Puzzle Programs</a>,
did some consulting with the <a href="http://momath.org/">National Museum of Math</a>,
and designed a puzzle challenge for
<a href="http://www.theleadersfoundry.com/">The Leaders Foundry</a>.</p>

<p>With a fresh coat of paint (courtesy
<a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/clean-blog/">http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/clean-blog/</a>) I plan to keep this
site better updated with my projects and musings.</p>
