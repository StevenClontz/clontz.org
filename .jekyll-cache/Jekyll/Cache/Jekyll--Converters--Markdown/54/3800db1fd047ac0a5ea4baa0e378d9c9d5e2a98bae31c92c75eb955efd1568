I"‘<p>This is a problem that‚Äôs been thrown around the Facebook recently it seems. Man, it seems so simple:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">6√∑2(1+2)=?</script>

<p>Simple until you ask a group of people what the answer is, and find out half of us think it‚Äôs nine, and the other half think it‚Äôs one.</p>

<p>So what IS the answer?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Short answer: it‚Äôs a terribly written problem, or more accurately, it‚Äôs a problem written solely to make people argue over its order of operations. It touches on the ambiguity of parentheses, multiplication, and division in the ‚ÄúPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally / Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction‚Äù mnemonic.</p>

<p>The issue stems from the incorrect (but often subconscious) belief that there exists a Bible of Mathematics somewhere, which decrees every detail of how arithmetic should be expressed and simplified. As simple as the problem seems, there‚Äôs no prevailing convention on whether $6√∑2$ or $2(1+2)$ gets precedence here. Particularly when half of school teachers say multiplication has precedence over division, and half say multiplication and division have equal precedence and are evaluated left-to-right. (And hey does implied multiplication by parentheses fall into the P or M of PEMDAS?)</p>

<p>In the real world of mathematics, this is as unanswerable a question as me asking ‚ÄúIs there a mathematical size bigger than the amount of integers but less than the amount of real numbers?‚Äù <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> because you can‚Äôt address it without first specifying the rules you are allowed to use on the problem.</p>

<p>Thus I‚Äôm forced to settle for what we call a ‚Äúconsistency result‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If √∑ division takes precedence over implied multiplication located further to the right, then $6√∑2(1+2)=9$. If not, then $6√∑2(1+2)=1$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs the best that can be done, mathematically. If you wanted a definitive answer, you should have asked me to evaluate $(6√∑2)(1+2)$ or $6√∑(2(1+2))$. That‚Äôs what parentheses are for, anyway.</p>

<p><small id="footnote-1">[1] This is something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">The Continuum Hypothesis</a>. We use the word ‚Äúhypothesis‚Äù here because once mathematicians formalized the rules of set theory (well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">one set of rules for set theory</a>), it couldn‚Äôt be proven true or false. We later proved that it <em>couldn‚Äôt</em> be proven true or false, basically because we didn‚Äôt provide enough rules to handle the question. So just like $6√∑2(1+2)=9$ or $6√∑2(1+2)=1$ depending on what rules we use, we can assume the answer to the Continuum Hypothesis is either yes <em>or</em> no.</small></p>

<p>Or we can completely ignore it and go on with our lives, just like we do with other silly questions like $6√∑2(1+2)=?$.&lt;/small&gt;</p>

<p>Addendum: Someone rightfully pointed out on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5391415">Hacker News</a> that calling the Continuum Hypothesis a ‚Äúsilly‚Äù question doesn‚Äôt do it justice. Rather, I mean that posing the Continuum Hypothesis as a ‚Äúyes or no‚Äù question is silly.</p>
