I"ﬁ!<p>In response to a <a href="https://twitter.com/katemath/status/1026848341177638914">discussion</a> on Twitter
with Kate Owens and Drew Lewis,
I wanted to document my experience using the Study Plan
in Person‚Äôs Study Plan feature within its MyLabMath
(MyMathLab? MyLab Math?) product.</p>

<p>For various reasons outside the scope of this blog post, 
I chose to make the <a href="https://prof.clontz.org/classes/2018/06/ma125/">course</a>
(click for the syllabus) grade 85% based on the Study Plan,
and 15% on the Final Exam.
With 85% based on the Study Plan, I of course needed to ensure two
things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Completion of the Study Plan should reflect true mastery
of the course objectives.</li>
  <li>I should be able to reasonably guarantee that academic honesty
had been respected by my students.</li>
</ol>

<p>For #1, I began by reviewing my options. In the Study Plan,
instructors can see a master list of all ‚Äúobjectives‚Äù by visiting
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Study Plan &gt; Manage &gt; Coverage and Scoring</code>. Each objective may be
selected as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Scored and recommended</code> (counts towards the Study Plan grade) 
and/or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Available for practice</code> (appears in the student Study Plan).
In my implementation, I always used both options together (and I‚Äôm not sure
why anyone wouldn‚Äôt at least include all scored objectives in practice), 
so I won‚Äôt distinguish them further here.</p>

<p>To design my course, I went through and first checked/unchecked the sections
of the textbook that my <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/colleges/artsandsci/mathstat/syllabi/ma125.html">department course syllabus</a>
designated. Then within each section, I checked/unchecked objectives
according to the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I covered all the ‚Äúlearning objectives‚Äù given on my department‚Äôs course
syllabus.</li>
  <li>Even if it wasn‚Äôt explicitly given as a ‚Äúlearning objective‚Äù, I included
objectives that either supported future objectives or I simply thought
were important.</li>
  <li>I tried to limit myself to four or less objectives per section, with
five as my absolute maximum.</li>
  <li>There existed multiple reasonable exercises for students to complete
when practicing and being assessed in MyLab Math.</li>
</ul>

<p>Per the last point: each objective can be expanded into its supporting
exercises in MyLab Math. Often, many of the exercises were either too easy
or too perfidious to be worthwhile as either practice or assessment.
(I suppose there‚Äôs an argument to only include these in practice; I chose
not to.) So I selected the exercises that seemed reasonable tractable and
relevant for assessment; there were a few interesting objectives I
abandoned due to a lack of quality exercises.</p>

<p>Here is where I diverged from the intended use case of the Study Plan.
Pearson, for some unintelligible reason, has designed the Study Plan as
though only the student is interested in knowing their mastery of course
material. So while there is the ability for instructors to see Study
Plan progress and use it as a part of the grade on MyLabMath, there are
<del>two</del> three serious anti-patterns in Pearson‚Äôs design (that I‚Äôve reported to them,
not that I anticipate any changes):</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>UPDATE 2018-08-08:</em> <strong>Study Plan mastery is set by student account, not by
the course.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This isn‚Äôt bad in of itself, but the only way to fairly assess based on
work done during your course is to enable an option in the Study Plan to
scrub all previous progress in the Study Plan from previous semesters. I wish
there was a way to have a course-level Study Plan that somehow shadows the
student-level Study Plan. There‚Äôs possibly a major security issue here if a student
has access to a second MyLabMath course that can improve the Study Plan;
that depends on how Pearson has implemented things behind the scenes and
I cannot tell.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The default/natural way to configure the Study Plan for students to
demonstrate mastery is through a ‚ÄúQuiz Me‚Äù feature. After students
click the ‚ÄúPractice‚Äù button and correctly solve a few relevant exercises,
the ‚ÄúQuiz Me‚Äù button becomes available, which generates a random quiz
based upon that sole objective.
<strong>There is no way to password-protect this feature.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the above issue directly contradicts Thing #2 listed above. Fortunately,
this can be disabled. Instead, students can be required to instead answer a relevant exercise
from an assigned assessment via <code class="highlighter-rouge">Study Plan &gt; Manage &gt; Mastery</code>. This brings up the
second anti-pattern.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pearson expects instructors to design their assessments first, and then generate
Study Plans based upon those assessments. 
<strong>This is in conflict with <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/">backwards design</a>‚Ä†, and there is no automatic
way to generate assessments from a carefully curated Study Plan.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>However, despite the shrugging I got from Pearson when I asked, I did find a way
to hand-create assessments from an existing Study Plan without too much pain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I created a quiz for each section (or two sections if they summed to four/five objectives)
using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Assignments &gt; Manage &gt; Create Assignment</code>.</li>
  <li>I named the quiz for that section(s), and did not create a companion Study Plan
since I already had done that work at the beginning as a part of my backwards design.</li>
  <li>Under <code class="highlighter-rouge">Add/Remove Content</code>, I chose the Chapter and Objective, and then under Availability
I chose ‚ÄúQuestions that are in the Study Plan‚Äù.</li>
  <li>Then for each Objective that would list questions (which were in my Study Plan),
I hit the ‚Äúcheck all‚Äù box and clicked ‚ÄúPool‚Äù to create a quiz exercise that would be
chosen randomly from that pool.</li>
  <li>I set a password for the quiz and let it be available for the entire semester.
<em>UPDATE 2018-08-08:</em> Quizzes could be attempted infinitely many times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since a password was set, students were required to visit our on-campus Math Technology Lab
to complete quizzes. For this summer MTWRF class, I actually did not cover new material
on Fridays to let students visit the lab and work on quizzes. They could also reclaim
their Friday afternoons to do other things, and work on quizzes at another time during
the week that the lab was open as well. (I made an error here: I should have required students
to either spend a sufficient amount of time or made a sufficient amount of progress 
in the lab working on quizzes in MyLabMath, since I believe
that data is available, or else they should have been forced to come to class on Friday.)</p>

<p><em>UPDATE 2018-08-08:</em> In the gradebook, there were only two entries: 85% for the Study Plan,
and 15% for the Final Exam. Note in particular that Quizzes were worth 0% directly, but
they updated the Study Plan, so each correct response was essentially
worth about 1% of the overall grade for the course.</p>

<p>Overall I think this went well. A major downside was the inability to assess twice in
MyLabMath: while I don‚Äôt usually consider a standard ‚Äúmastered‚Äù until it has been
demonstrated as mastered twice on separate weeks, there‚Äôs no way to enforce this in
MyLabMath directly (as far as I know). So this was part of the justification for the final,
as students knew they would need to hit the high points of the course one more time
at the semester‚Äôs end. However, because the final was so weakly weighted, I‚Äôm unconvinced
it was very useful. (Of course, there are other reasons to give a final besides
pedagogical soundness‚Ä¶) My final was given on paper, separate from MyLabMath, and
did not affect the Study Plan at all.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Using the MyLabMath Study Plan for SBG is better than using MyLabMath
for pretty much anything else. They could make the product a lot better, but I haven‚Äôt
been given much evidence that Pearson cares. Given a repeat of the situation I was in
(a short-notice prep for a summer freshman math course), I‚Äôd probably do everything
again the same way, with the above noted exceptions.</p>

<hr />

<p><small>‚Ä† What an unfortunate name: I get that we want to start by thinking about
what our students should master by the end of the course, but ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù certainly
comes off as‚Ä¶ well, backwards.</small></p>
