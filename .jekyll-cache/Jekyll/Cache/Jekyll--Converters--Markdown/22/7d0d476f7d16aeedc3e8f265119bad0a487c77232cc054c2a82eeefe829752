<h2 id="relationship-of-math-and-comp-sci">Relationship of Math and Comp Sci</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Math folks: knowing computer science/engineering can help you get a job.
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t have to take classes; just pick up a fun sideproject!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CS folks: knowing math can help you get a job.
    <ul>
      <li>Having a math background makes people think you’re (a) smart,
(b) a problem-solver (in general).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I hope to see future collaborations between ACM and Math Club, and I
encourage members of both groups to be involved with the other and
leadership to work together to support their memberships.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-topology">What is Topology?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Topology is the a of mathematical structure that generalizes geometry
and calculus.
    <ul>
      <li>Classic example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology#/media/File:Mug_and_Torus_morph.gif">donut and coffee cup</a></li>
      <li>My favorite example: <a href="http://mappmath.org/puzzles/">topology of fonts</a></li>
      <li>Big data application: <a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/barcodes.pdf">persistent homology</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One goal of topology is to identify the properties of topological spaces
that characterize them.
    <ul>
      <li>Compactness: \([0,1]\) is compact, but
\(\mathbb{R}\) is not.</li>
      <li>Hausdorff: \([0,1]\) is Hausdorff, but an indiscrete space is not.</li>
      <li>Normal: \([0,1]\) must be normal, because it is compact &amp; Hausdorff.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-pi-base">What is pi-Base?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Topologists have studied thousands of topological spaces and thousands of
topological properties over the past century.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterexamples_in_Topology">Counterexamples in Topology</a> surveyed about 160 of
these spaces and about 60 of these properties in 1970.</li>
      <li>Paraphrasing the famous topologist Mary Ellen Rudin in her
review of Counterexamples,
<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2318037?origin=crossref&amp;seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents">topology is a dense forest of counterexamples, and a usable map of the forest is a fine thing</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="http://pi-base.org">pi-Base</a> began as a sideproject of my colleague
<a href="http://jdabbs.com/">James Dabbs</a> to digitize this information into a user-friendly
web app.</li>
      <li>Later pi-Base was opened up to community contributions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Features:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://topology.jdabbs.com/properties/P000013">Properties</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://topology.jdabbs.com/spaces/S000026">Spaces</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://topology.jdabbs.com/spaces/S000026/properties/P000013">Theorems</a></li>
      <li>Canonical naming as in <a href="http://oeis.org/A000045">OEIS</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-is-pi-base-going">Where is pi-Base going?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Currently I have a small grant to convert pi-Base into a modern tool for
mathematical researchers.
    <ul>
      <li>Major flaw in current version: lack of citations and peer-review.</li>
      <li>ACM officer Cody Martin worked for me last summer to add citations
from pi-Base to Counterexamples.</li>
      <li>Once this audit is complete, all contributions will require references
to a peer-reviewed manuscript to be marked as verified.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>pi-Base will become a treasure trove for undergraduate research.
    <ul>
      <li>There are still many unknowns in topology.</li>
      <li>pi-Base can automatically catalog space/property pairs that are missing.</li>
      <li>Three possibilities:
        <ul>
          <li>The question has been answered in literature not in pi-Base.</li>
          <li>The question hasn’t been answered because it’s hard.</li>
          <li>The question hasn’t been answered because no one’s tried: perfect
for undergrads!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
