I"9<p>I am a published researcher in
set-theoretic topology and continuum theory, serving as a tenure-track
assistant professor at the <a href="http://southalabama.edu">University of South Alabama</a>.</p>

<p>My specializations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>selection principles and games</li>
  <li>limited information strategies in selection games
and other topological games</li>
  <li>generalized inverse limits indexed by arbitrary total orders and bonded
with idempotent maps</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, my work as a mathematician strongly influences my
<a href="/teaching/">teaching</a> and <a href="/puzzles/">game and puzzle design</a>.</p>
