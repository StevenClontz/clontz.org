I"ñ<p>Here is an outline of the talk I gave at the AU set-theoretic topology
seminar on 2017 Feb 06.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Definition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Mazur_game">Banach-Mazur Game</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Introduced by Mazur as Problem 43 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Book">Scottish Book</a>
<a href="http://kielich.amu.edu.pl/Stefan_Banach/pdf/ks-szkocka/ks-szkocka3ang.pdf">[pdf]</a>, a notebook kept by mathematicians frequenting
the Scottish Cafe in LwÃ³w, Poland in the 1930s and 1940s.</li>
      <li>Let \(S\subseteq\mathbb R\). Two players alternate choosing
decreasing intervals
\(N_0\supseteq E_0\supseteq N_1\supseteq E_1\supseteq\dots\).
The first player wins if \(\bigcap_{n&lt;\omega}N_n\) contains a point of
\(S\); the first player wins otherwise.</li>
      <li>Banach (1935) showed that the second player has a winning strategy for
this game if and only if \(S\) is <em>meager</em>, a countable union
of nowhere-dense sets. The prize was a bottle of wine, awarded by Mazur.</li>
      <li>Our variant of interest: two players choose<br />
decreasing non-empty open subsets
\(E_0\supseteq N_0\supseteq E_1\supseteq N_1\supseteq\dots\)
of a topological space \(X\), and let the <em>second</em> player win if and
only if \(\bigcap_{n&lt;\omega}N_n\not=\emptyset\).
Call this game \(BM(X)\).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Limited information strategies
    <ul>
      <li>Let \(M\) be a set of possible moves for a game.</li>
      <li>A (perfect information) strategy is a function
\(\sigma:M^{&lt;\omega}\to M\) that determines the next move for a player
based upon all the previous moves of her opponent.</li>
      <li>A \(k\)-tactical strategy is a function
\(\sigma:M^{\leq k}\to M\) that determines the next move for a player
based upon the most recent \(k\) previous moves of her opponent.</li>
      <li>A \(k\)-Markov strategy is a function
\(\sigma:M^{\leq k}\times\omega\to M\)
that determines the next move for a player
based upon the most recent \(k\) moves of her opponent and the current
round number.</li>
      <li>A coding strategy is a function
\(\sigma:M^{\leq 2}\to M\)
that determines the next move for a player
based upon the most recent moves of both players.</li>
      <li>A strategy is <em>winning</em> if a player that follows the strategy is
guaranteed to win the game regardless of the moves of the opponent.</li>
      <li>A winning (perfect information) strategy for the second player in
\(BM(X)\) may always be improved to a winning coding strategy.
(Debs 1985; Galvin,Telgarsky 1986)</li>
      <li>A winning Markov (that is, \(1\)-Markov)
strategy for the second player in
\(BM(X)\) may always be improved to a winning tactical
(that is, \(1\)-tactical, also known as stationary) strategy.
(Galvin,Telgarsky 1986)</li>
      <li>Debs (1985) found examples of spaces for which the second player
in \(BM(X)\) has winning
(\(2\)-tactical; see Bartoszynski,Scheepers,Just 1993)
strategies, but no winning tactical strategies.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.telgarsky.com/1987-RMJM-Telgarsky-Topological-Games.pdf">Telgarksy conjectures (1987)</a>
that there exist spaces \(X_k\) for \(k&lt;\omega\)
such that the second player in
\(BM(X_k)\) has a winning \((k+1)\)-tactical
strategy, but no winning \(k\)-tactical strategy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Countable/Finite Games
    <ul>
      <li>Scheepers (1992) published the first of many papers under the
title of <em>Meager-Nowhere Dense Games: \(n\)-Tactics</em>.</li>
      <li>Let \(MG(X)\) be a game where the first player
chooses meager subsets \(M_{n+1}\supseteq M_n\) during round \(n+1\),
followed by the second player choosing a nowhere dense subset
\(N_{n+1}\). The second player wins if
\(\bigcup_{n&lt;\omega}N_n\supseteq\bigcup_{n&lt;\omega}M_n\).</li>
      <li>The special case where \(X=\kappa\) has the co-finite topology
(and therefore the first player chooses countable sets and the second
player chooses finite sets) was studied by Scheepers in
<em>Concerning \(n\)-tactics in the countable-finite game</em>.
Call this game \(Sch^{\cup,\supsetneq}(\kappa)\).</li>
      <li>Scheepers showed that any \((k+3)\)-tactical strategy for the second
player in \(Sch^{\cup,\supsetneq}(\kappa)\)
may be improved to a \(k\)-tactical strategy.</li>
      <li>Modification: \(Sch^{\cap}(\kappa)\): the first player chooses
any countable set \(C_n\), and the second player chooses any finite set
\(F_n\). The second player wins if
\(\bigcup_{n&lt;\omega}F_n\supseteq\bigcap_{n&lt;\omega}C_n\).</li>
      <li>The axiom \(\mathcal Aâ€™(\kappa)\) implies that the second player
has a winning \(2\)-tactical strategy in
\(Sch^{\cup,\supsetneq}(\kappa)\) (Scheepers) and
a winning \(2\)-Markov strategy in
\(Sch^{\cap}(\kappa)\) (Clontz).</li>
      <li>\(Aâ€™(\aleph_n)\) holds in ZFC for \(n&lt;\omega\) (Clontz,Dow to appear);
\(Aâ€™(\kappa)\) may be forced to hold for arbitrarily large
\(\kappa\leq\mathfrak c\) (Scheepers).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Selection Games
    <ul>
      <li>Let \(G_{fin}(\mathcal A,\mathcal B)\)
be the game where the first player chooses
\(A_n\in \mathcal A\) and the second player chooses a finite subset
\(B_n\in[A_n]^{&lt;\omega}\). The second player wins if
\(\bigcup_{n&lt;\omega}B_n\in\mathcal B\).</li>
      <li>For each cardinal \(\kappa\), let \(L(\kappa)=\kappa\cup\{\infty\}\)
be the space with \(\kappa\) discrete and \(\infty\) having
co-countable neighborhoods.</li>
      <li>Let the Menger game be
\(Men(X)=G_{fin}(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)\) where \(\mathcal O\)
is the set of open covers of \(X\).</li>
      <li>In regards to \(k\)-Markov strategies for the second player,
\(Men(L(\kappa))\) and \(Sch^{\cap}(\kappa)\) are equivalent
(Clontz).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Markov strategies in Selection Games
    <ul>
      <li>Any \((k+2)\)-Markov strategy for the second player in
\(G_{fin}(\mathcal A,\mathcal B)\) may be improved to a
\(2\)-Markov strategy.

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Assume \(|\bigcup\mathcal A|\leq\aleph_0\) and \(\mathcal B\)
is closed under supersets. Then any winning (perfect-information)
strategy for the second player in \(G_{fin}(\mathcal A,\mathcal B)\)
may be improved to a Markov strategy.

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Corollaries:
        <ul>
          <li>Let \(\mathcal D\) give the dense subsets of a space \(X\).
The second player having a winning strategy in
\(G_{fin}(\mathcal D,\mathcal D)\) characterizes
strategic selective separability, \(SS^+\). Thus all countable
\(SS^+\) spaces are Markov selectively separable, \(SS^{+mark}\).
(Barman,Dow 2012).</li>
          <li>The second player having a winning strategy in
\(G_{fin}(\mathcal O,\mathcal O)\) characterizes the
strategic Menger property.
All second-countable strategic Menger spaces are Markov Menger.
Markov Menger spaces are exactly the
\(\sigma\)-relatively-compact spaces
(equivalent to \(\sigma\)-compact for regular spaces). (Clontz)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Question (Gruenhage): Does there exist an \(SS^+\) space that is not
\(SS^{+mark}\)?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
