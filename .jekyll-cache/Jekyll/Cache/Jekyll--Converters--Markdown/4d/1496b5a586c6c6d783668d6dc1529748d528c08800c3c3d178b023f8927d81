I",<p>I’ve been known to dabble in a few other areas, in particular
entrepreneurship and software development.</p>

<p>My programming experience covers a variety of platforms and
languages, including Ruby, Python, and Javascript.
Naturally, a lot my work in those languages involves web development,
but I’ve been known to hack on a few other types of projects
as well.</p>

<p>I’m a strong believer in open-source. If it weren’t for free languages and
libraries I’d never have picked up programming as a hobby, much less a
vocation. By working as a community, we can create robust and secure
applications for the betterment of society.</p>

<p>My largest project so far was co-founding and developing
<a href="http://teloga.com">Teloga.com</a>, a CRM for
collegiate music organizations which operated from 2011-2015. It
was built on Ruby on Rails (previously Django) and AngularJS. I’ve also done
technology consulting for organizations such as the
<a href="http://auburn.edu/math/">AU Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a>
and the <a href="http://momath.org">National Museum of Mathematics</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://github.com/StevenClontz">GitHub</a> has a bunch of my repos if
you want to see what I’m working on. You can also check out
