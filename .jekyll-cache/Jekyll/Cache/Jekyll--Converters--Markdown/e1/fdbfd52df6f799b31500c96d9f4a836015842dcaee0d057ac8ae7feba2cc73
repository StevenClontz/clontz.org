I"r<p>I’m glad to report that this year’s first
<a href="http://mappmath.org">MaPP</a> High School Challenge was a success! We ran
it at UNC Charlotte on Saturday, and received high praise from the teachers
who brought their teams. For one, we were told by a teacher that she was
concerned that we wouldn’t be able to find room for all the teams she
expected to show up next year. That’s a good problem to have, I think.</p>
