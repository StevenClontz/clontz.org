<h2 id="about-my-teaching">About my Teaching</h2>

<p>I love teaching! I trace this enthusiasm back to
my tenure as a National Youth Leadership Training
staffer at Camp Westmoreland in the BSA’s Greater Alabama Council.
NYLT utilizes youth instructors for teaching all courses, giving my
teenaged self the opportunity to educate my peers on how to be
better leaders and teachers. Years later I used those skills as
I became an instructor of mathematics at several institutions of
higher education.</p>

<h2 id="evaluations">Evaluations</h2>

<p>During my time at Auburn University, UNC Charlotte, and now
South Alabama, I’ve had the
opportunity to work with hundreds of students as the instructor of
several mathematics courses. I think that I’ve done well overall, and this
is reflected by the evaluations they’ve left me. I’ve included excerpts
from each semester I’ve taught since Fall 2012 on my
<a href="/teaching/evaluations/">evaluations page</a>.</p>
