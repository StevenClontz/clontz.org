I"Ø<p>I‚Äôve been asked for my thoughts on how my semester teaching
a three-week sophomore-level linear algebra course went,
particularly to answer the question: ‚ÄúIs mastery grading
a reasonable system to use during a minimester?‚Äù The course
ran daily for about three hours each day (so the equivalent
of one regular week of class per day). For me,
mastery grading is tangled with my use of a active pedagogy
called Team-Based Inquiry Learning, so this post will address
both.</p>

<p>Briefly, my mastery grading system tracks evidence of student
understanding of 24 course standards. Students may earn up to
two checkmarks per standard by submitting a completely correct
solution for a relevant exercise, via daily quizzes (with
at-home revisions allowed for very minor errors, but they still 
must resubmit a completely correct solution). Grades are
determined purely upon the number of mastery checkmarks earned
during the semester.</p>

<p>Also briefly, Team-Based Inquiry Learning is a carefully
scaffolded sequence of activities designed to have students
discover as much of the mathematics as possible on their own.
This includes a readiness assurance process to bridge the gap
from (perhaps forgotten) prerequisite material, and each
activity is discussed in teams (or one team in the case of
this small class) before responding via multiple choice or
a written solution on a vertical whiteboard.</p>

<p>Less briefly, more details can be found on my course syllabus
here: <a href="https://prof.clontz.org/classes/2019/05/ma237/">https://prof.clontz.org/classes/2019/05/ma237/</a>.</p>

<p>More briefly than anything, here‚Äôs my bottom line. All five students
passed with a C or better (possibly B or better depending
on how their finals turned out), and none of my students reported any
complaints about the course structure to me, so I would highly
recommend the use of active learning and mastery grading to
any instructor of a mini-semester mathematics course.</p>

<h2 id="student-reactions">Student Reactions</h2>

<p>I‚Äôll begin with some student reactions I gathered this morning.
These should be taken with a grain of salt: I only have five
students this semester, and I asked them for their feedback in
person just moments before their final. I‚Äôll get the anonymous
evaluations sometime this fall; if those indicate any feedback
drastically different from what I write below, I‚Äôll update
this post.</p>

<p>When asked for their general feedback on how our
‚Äúteam-based whiteboard activities and checkmark-based mastery
grading system‚Äù supported or conflicted with the three-week
mini-semester, the responses were entirely positive.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Students appreciated that I gave daily mastery quizzes that
allowed them to add checkmarks to their progress report. This
gave them incentive to keep up with the daily grind of new
material.</li>
  <li>They remarked that the format was the reason that every
student had perfect attendance (with the slight excpetion of one
student who was an hour late due to a flight delay). It wasn‚Äôt
said directly, but I suspect the subtext here was that
they would not have felt encouraged to attend class daily
without the daily quizzes to improve their grade, or if
the class was just three hours of me talking at them.</li>
  <li>Students specifically mentioned that they really appreciated
being kept engaged in the course via multiple choice activities
and working out problems on the whiteboard together. While
ungraded multiple-choice activities may not seem very deep,
I should emphasize that the point of these is not to find an
answer, but the discussion that leads to the answer. I made a
(faux) big deal about not confirming their thoughts until
they committed to a specific choice, allowing them to come
up with many of the big ideas of the course on their own
through discussion of my questions.</li>
  <li>Students suggested that they learned <em>more</em> in this
intense three-week format than they would have over fifteen
weeks. I suspect this is a product of mastery grading, which
gave them daily opportunities to either prove mastery, or
recieve my feedback on how they could improve on each standard
assessed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adjustments-and-non-adjustments">Adjustments and Non-Adjustments</h2>

<p>I did not run the course exactly how I would have run a fifteen-week
semester, but I also probably didn‚Äôt change as much as you might
think.</p>

<p>First thing to note is that I didn‚Äôt change anything about the
<a href="https://github.com/stevenclontz/tbil-la">TBIL active learning materials</a> 
that I coauthored with Drew Lewis, even though
they were designed for a 15-week course. I usually spend two 50 or 60 minute
periods each week on covering material via those activities; so instead
I just spent about two hours each day this semester covering the same
material, with the rest used for assessment of mastery.</p>

<p>Since I had only one team, I didn‚Äôt have to spend time leveling
weaker teams to catch them up with the stronger teams. Also, the team
I had this semester was stronger than average. This probably helped:
I actually covered all the core material for the course in this way
using only 12 days of class (e.g. the time I‚Äôd have during twelve weeks of
a normal fifteen-week semester). The rest of the time was used for
covering applications of linear algebra, additional time for assessing
mastery, and review.</p>

<p>I usually offer ‚Äúoffice reassessments‚Äù, and did this semester at first.
These are untimed reattempts to master standards that I stopped asking
about on daily quizzes, available on a limited basis to students
who were active in the course and who showed me that had done some limited
homeowrk.</p>

<p>However, after a full three hours each morning, I found the students
weren‚Äôt super interested in returning after lunch for more assessment
of their linear algebra skills. So I asked them if they‚Äôd rather I just
offered ‚Äúrequiz‚Äù opportunities, where they completed the same requirements,
but instead of an untimed attempt in my office hours, they would be given
an additional exercise for that standard to be completed during the usual
quiz period. They said they‚Äôd prefer that, so that‚Äôs what we did.
I ended spending less than an hour all semester in ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù.</p>

<p>Even still, I had far less requests for reassessments/requizzes than
I usually do during a semester. I suspect this is because that a
common reason for reassessment is distraction from other classes (e.g.
a big exam) that cause a student to punt on preparing for certain
standards at certain times. This isn‚Äôt an issue during a minimester
where the students shouldn‚Äôt be taking more than one course.</p>

<p>I definitely provided a larger percentage of in-class time for assessment 
than I usually do in a semester (which also probably impacted the
reduced need for reassessments). Partially this is because I could
due to the rapid progress of my team of students. But even still, I would 
often let students go 15 minutes early because they had blown through
the material, so with a larger class or a class that needed more of my
direct support I‚Äôd keep that ratio of in-class assessment time. Since
I used mastery grading, assessment isn‚Äôt a burden. It‚Äôs either an
opportunity for practice, feedback, and reflection, or it‚Äôs an <em>unloading
of burden</em> because they were able to demonstrate mastery and check off
something on their progress report.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, I wrote it at the end of the introduction. :-) For some added
context, my wife works at an elementary school, so there‚Äôs added incentive
for me to teach during May rather than June or July. But I think the
semester was a huge success regardless, and I hope to offer the course again
next May.</p>
