I"¦<p>My last class teaching at Auburn came sooner than expected. Starting in the spring, Iâ€™ll be working as the software engineer / web developer / IT specialist for Auburnâ€™s <a href="https://fp.auburn.edu/writing/">Office of University Writing</a>, specifically the <a href="https://fp.auburn.edu/writing/eportfolio-project/">ePortfolio Project</a>. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll post more about that down the road - I start on January 7th.</p>

<p>I had a great group of students in this final semester. And it seems they thought I was okay too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Best math teacher Iâ€™ve had at Auburn. Seems like heâ€™s having fun teaching and really enjoys his job here at Auburn. He isnâ€™t as mundane as the rest of the math departmentâ€™s professors and teachers. Overall, a funny nice guy with a great attitude and a love for what heâ€™s doing.</p>
