I"¶<p>Back when I was in undergrad, some friends and I decided to spend our Spring Break taking a road trip to Alamogordo, New Mexico, to make a documentary about the Atari E.T. game failure. Long story short, the game was a flop, and according to the folklore millions of copies were buried in a landfill in that city.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, lack of funds kept us from our mission. Occassionally I‚Äôll be contacted about our attempt, and while there really isn‚Äôt much to say, I always try to contribute. The latest publication es en espa√±ol, so I‚Äôll add my original quote in English after the break.</p>

<p>The article seems to take excerpts from the following quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We didn‚Äôt get too far into specifics before the reality of the costs of the project set in. (Gas prices rose drastically in the US during 2008, and we didn‚Äôt have a very efficient vehicle.) However, I did schedule an interview with the mayor of Alamogordo, New Mexico (which we canceled, obviously), and we uncovered news articles from around that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most important thing I realized is that the story may in fact just be a myth! There‚Äôs certainly a lot of evidence that it happened, but there‚Äôs also certainly not a fenced in pile of dirt with an ‚ÄúAtari‚Äù sign hanging on the side anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apparently that location is now a parking lot. I don‚Äôt think the owners would have appreciated us trying to dig‚Ä¶ but yeah, we‚Äôd probably find some dirt there and try anyway. It would have been a great scene at least.</p>
