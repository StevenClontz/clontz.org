I"û<p>Itâ€™s been way too long since I updated, but I wanted to share the revival of my most popular app: <a href="http://gradecalc.stevenclontz.com">GradeCalc</a>. Development notes follow.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d been thinking about updating my aged <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~clontsc/deadday-archive.php">Dead Day Grade Calculator</a> for a while now - for such a simple app it seemed that a static Javascript-powered site was the way to go.</p>

<p>But there was no way I was abandoning conveniences like <a href="http://slim-lang.com/">Slim</a> or <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> to write out all the HTML and JS by hand. Enter <a href="http://nanoc.ws/">nanoc</a> - I can develop in Slim/LESS/Coffee, and then Guard automatically generates static HTML/CSS/JS. I set up a separate Git repo in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/output</code> folder to push to <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code>, took about five minutes to set up the subdomain, and in about ten hours I had set up a site far more polished than my sad PHP-powered 2008 attempt.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m happy to hear any feedback! Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:steven@clontz.org">steven@clontz.org</a>. (Yup thatâ€™s new.)</p>
