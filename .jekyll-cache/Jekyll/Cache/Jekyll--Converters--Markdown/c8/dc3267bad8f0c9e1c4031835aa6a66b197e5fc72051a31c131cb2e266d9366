I"A<p>I will be presenting my research tomorrow morning (2013-02-27) for the Graduate Student Council Scholars’ Forum, a preliminary event for AU Research Week. It’s intended to showcase graduate student research for a general audience.</p>

<p>Hopefully I’ll do an okay job! If you’re interested in my research, I’ve made the presentation available on <a href="https://github.com/StevenClontz/2013-au-research-week-presentation/">GitHub</a> (and <a href="/aurw-2013/">added a page to my site</a>).</p>
