relevant links for now.)

- [Overleaf.com][overleaf] and [ShareLaTeX.com][sharelatex]
    - Online LaTeX editors
    - Typeset professional documents and save/share them in the cloud
- [ResearchGate.net][researchgate]
    - Professional network for academics
    - Connect with colleagues at other institutions (useful
      for potential name recommendation, but cannot replace
      networking in real life)

    - One of the main job posting websites for academic jobs
      in mathematics
