## Typesetting Professional Documents with Overleaf/ShareLaTeX

Something you can start doing now, no matter how far off your job hunt is,
is learn to typeset professional documents. In addition to writing research
papers, it's good practice to use professional-looking templates based on the
LaTeX typesetting system. Learning LaTeX isn't hard, especially if you use
cloud LaTeX services like [Overleaf][overleaf] and [ShareLaTeX][sharelatex].

Both websites allow you to select pre-made templates for CVs, cover letters,
and so on. You can then open up the LaTeX code within your web browser,
make your edits to customize its contents to yourself, and then save/share the
result online or download a PDF. First impressions are important, and using
LaTeX to typeset documents is the industry standard, so it's wise to use it when
presenting yourself to prospective future collegues.

## Networking online and in real life

Your main goal as an applicant is to get your foot in the door. In a sea of
qualified applicants, you only have a few opporunities to catch a search committee's
attention. One important way is to have a colleague at the school you're applying to.
That means that as soon as you have research to share, you need to start going to
conferences and meeting people in your field. 

There's a very small chance that you'll
know someone on the search committee. Howeer, many search committees will ask their
colleagues for input. Those collegues will probably (at most) look through the list of
applicant names, their schools, and their fields. So, you want your name to be familiar
to that colleague, at least enough that they will take the extra step to read your cover 
letter.

There's no substitute for meeting colleagues in real life. However, another tool you can use
to follow up on a real life connection is [ResearchGate][researchgate].
