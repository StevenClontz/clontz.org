TODO: Writeup introduction. But, to be clear, this page will be
chock-full of **SPOILERS** for Zero Time Dilemma.

## Coincide

So... I've woken up with the nine characters I've been told to
expect from the previews and trailers I've seen.
Surprise, everyone is scared of a kid in a mask
who (I assume we will soon be told) is named by a single letter.
Man, there wasn't much of an intro here... did I miss a cool
movie when I started up the game?

### Heads or Tails

Zero asked me (Carlos?) to call a coin flip.
I followed Junpei's advice to call Blue, because hey, Junpei
was a good partner in 999, why not trust him now?

We got it! So.. now we're going to escape?

### Payoff

And... now we wake up outside. Q kid is still a mystery. Actually
everything is, but there go the credits. Man, I hope I can
skip these in the future.

## CDQ-End:1

I'm not disappointed I got to an ending so quickly... in fact,
I kind of expected it. Was I really lucky when I picked Blue?
Guess I'll check on that movie I maybe missed.

Well, wait. Now I get to pick my character. Yeah, gotta go with Q.
Who is that kid anyway? Well, let's see if there's a video first,
seriously.

Nope? Okay. Going with Q. Back to **Heads or Tails**? Alright,
let's roll.

### Heads or Tails

Oh good, there's a skip button. Didn't use it though.

Wait, I get to make the decision still? Digging the decision theme music...
Let's see if Blue gets me the same outcome.

AWWW NAAAAW MAN!! Got it wrong. Whatever. Man that other new guy is
annoying. I know who I hope the first of the six characters who
must die are.

Wait, back to sleep? Okay.

*Aw yeah*, here's my opening cinematic.

### Confirmation(?)

*ed note, okay, that's just the confirmation window, whatevs*

Eric (there's the name) is still a jerk.

So, here's a lecture by Zero. Blah blah, life's unfair. So we've got
Carlos' C-Team, Q's Q-Team, and Diana's D-Team.

Woohoo, more anesthetic bracelets.

Okay, so we're collecting X-passes as people die.
Will I get to reuse them in later playthroughs to
save everyone?

### Execution:Q

Well, here's a bunch of rooms.

Man, I'm done with Eric. I'm gonna sacrifice this team by not voting,
just to get rid of him. What does Chesty McChesterson see in him?

Oooh, keypad. Maybe I'll get to remove the helmet at will once I
learn it?

Eric's giving me some Dio vibes. He's definitely gotta go.

Here's the dog. Man, now I feel like I should follow C-Team's plan.
Well, looks like not voting isn't an option anyway. Let's follow
the plan and vote for C. That's what I was supposed to do, right?


## Halfway through the first(?) set of fragments

Long since gave up on "live" thoughts.

Okay, so, I love serial killer Mira. Eric deserves her, but I'm sensing
that he'll turn up to be whiny/awful for a good reason.

I'm really digging the fragments system. I also look forward to seeing
how Zero manipulates the players by lying about memories and the time
on their watches. (Hey, why did the watch update time when they were
transported through time and space? Guess it has a wifi connection.)

But by far the best part is that I'm making the characters do awful
things, and they don't try to rationalize it, especially Luna, *cough*,
Diana. "I felt someone forcing my hand to press the button!" I'm just waiting
on them to break the fourth wall and talk to me. It's interesting that Zero
doesn't seem to recognize me as an element of the game, however, from the
way he treats Diana when she is forced to make evil decisions. (Or maybe
he's just a huge jerk.)
