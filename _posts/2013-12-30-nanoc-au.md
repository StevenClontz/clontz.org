Maybe I should get gross multiweek sinus infections more often. In addition to co-authoring my first ever topology paper to be submitted to a journal (I hope to share more about that soon!), I've spent the past couple of days hacking out an Auburn-themed version of the Ruby static site generator [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws).

If you are an Auburn student/employee/professor comfortable with the terminal (no Ruby experience required), and would like to roll out an Auburn-themed website, this is a very slick way to do it. Check out the example site here: <http://auburnwrites.github.io/nanoc-au/>.

UPDATE 2014-01-03: I've added a proof-of-concept here: <http://www.auburn.edu/~clontsc>
