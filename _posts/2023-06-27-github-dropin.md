Thanks to everyone for participating in today's drop-in discussion about GitHub!

The first repo I made is here: <https://github.com/StevenClontz/github-workshop-artifacts-20230627>

The Markdown Guide someone suggested in chat (thanks again): <https://markdownguide.org/>

To try out PreTeXt and Codespaces, start here: <https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/tutorial.html>

There's still a chance to participate in our Zoom workshop on PreTeXt this July as well: <https://prose.runestone.academy/summer/>

If you have any questions, email me at <steven.clontz@gmail.com> or drop in via Zoom during
a PROSE community dropin: <https://prose.runestone.academy/#upcoming-events>
