I'm glad to report that this year's first
[MaPP](http://mappmath.org) High School Challenge was a success! We ran
it at UNC Charlotte on Saturday, and received high praise from the teachers
who brought their teams. For one, we were told by a teacher that she was
concerned that we wouldn't be able to find room for all the teams she
expected to show up next year. That's a good problem to have, I think.
