- soon-to-be associate prof of mathematics at South AL
- grad school: ran startup powered by custom Ruby on Rails web app
	- secret sauce for Rails: install software; rails generate OR git clone; rails serve
- postPhD kept hacking on rails projects to facilitate my instruction (esp outcomes-based grading gradebook)
	- Jim Fowler invited me to Curated Courses workshop 2018, got into PreTeXt
	- wanted rails secret sauce for PreTeXt, hence CLI with Oscar
- other projects
	- coPI on [NSF grant studying Team-Based Inquiry Learning](https://sites.google.com/southalabama.edu/tbil/), with a dozen faculty collaborating on PreTeXt books for single-var Cal + linear algebra
	- [CheckIt](https://checkit.clontz.org/) random exercise generator to describe randomization in your favorite programming language and ship static HTML/JS app which lets anyone build PDF printable quizzes and Canvas question banks.
	- CheckIt templates are built using [SpaTeXt XML](https://spatext.clontz.org/), isomorphic to subset of PreTeXt but implemented in Javascript, exports to HTML, LaTeX, and PreTeXt
- general philosophy: build products that don't just technically work, but that humans actually want to use

### other notes

- 3blue1brown videos are built using an FOSS python library [`manim`](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim)
