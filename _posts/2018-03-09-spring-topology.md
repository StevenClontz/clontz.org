Here are a few useful resources related to my involvement at the
**52nd Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference**
at Auburn University, March 14-17.

## Conference Livestream

My students Cody Martin and Sam Formichella are assisting me in livestreaming
several plenary talks and set-theoretic topology talks for the conference.
A schedule and live video are available on my
[STDC2018 Livestream](/math/stdc-2018) page.

## pi-Base: A Usable Map of the Forest

Slides/notes for my research talk in the set-theoretic topology special session
will be made available here at a later date.

## Team-Based Learning and Standards-Based Grading

Slides/notes for my teaching talk in the Educational Advancement Foundation
workshop will be made available here at a later date.
