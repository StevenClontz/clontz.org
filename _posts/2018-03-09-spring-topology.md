Here are a few useful resources related to my involvement at the
**52nd Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference**
at Auburn University, March 14-17.

## Conference Livestream

My students Cody Martin and Sam Formichella are assisting me in livestreaming
several plenary talks and set-theoretic topology talks for the conference.
A schedule and live video are available on my
[STDC2018 Livestream](/math/stdc-2018) page.
