- Demo of *Intros-Blockly*: <https://stevenclontz.github.io/Intros-Blockly/>
- Fact: Many talented students of abstract mathematics, even those who will successfully defend a PhD dissertation someday, will not be in research faculty positions.
    - Of those, many will go into tech, often teaching themselves how to code or relying on previous CS coursework.
- Proposal: Why not scaffold mathematical engagement, *even abstract mathematics*, with technology?
- Source for *Intros-Blockly*: <https://github.com/brandon-sisler/Intros-Blockly>
- Open-source infrastructure for student mathematical projects:
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/) - repository for storing/sharing open-source code
    - [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) - free virtual computers to write/run code in a webbrowser (no installs!)
        - Example of push-button activation: <https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext-codespace>
- Open-source technologies to consider utilizing: 
    - Python/SageMath (lots of math functionality built-in)
    - HTML/Javascript (dissemination as static websites that can be accssed by directly visiting a URL)
- Obvious problem:
    - No one taught **us** how to do this stuff!
- Less obvious solutions?...
    - Find a tech solution for a problem *you* have in your faculty responsibilites, and convince yourself learning how to build it will save you time.
        - (Protip: it probably won't, but maybe it will help others...)
    - Convince leadership to value this work as scholarly activity.
- GitHub projects that need more mathematicians:
    - [PreTeXt-Runestone](https://prose.runestone.academy/), ecosystem for authoring, publishing, and researching open-source educational resources
    - [CheckIt](https://teambasedinquirylearning.github.io/linear-algebra/2023/exercises/#/bank/), framework for authoring open-source randomized assessments exportable to both print and LMS
    - [pi-Base](https://topology.pi-base.org/), database of topological spaces based upon Steen/Seebach's *Counterexamples in Topology* text
        - The [standard reference](https://math.stackexchange.com/search?q=url%3A%22*.jdabbs.com%22) for general topology questions on Math.StackExchange
