Conference travel continues this week. On Saturday, March 5 I'll be speaking
at the AMS Southeastern Sectional Meeting in Athens, Georgia
for the special session on
Inverse Limits and Dynamical Systems. This will
be followed by a similar talk on Friday, March
11 at the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference in Waco, Texas for
the special session on Continuum Theory.
