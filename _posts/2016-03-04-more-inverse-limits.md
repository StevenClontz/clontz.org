Academic travel continues this week, following
[the talk I gave at South Alabama yesterday](/blog/2016/02/29/south-alabama-presentation/).
On Saturday, March 5 I'll be speaking
at the AMS Southeastern Sectional Meeting in Athens, Georgia
for the special session on
Inverse Limits and Dynamical Systems. I'll also be giving a similar
talk on Friday, March
11 at the Spring Topology and Dynamics Conference in Waco, Texas for
the special session on Continuum Theory.
