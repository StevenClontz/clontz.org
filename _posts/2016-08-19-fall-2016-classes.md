Another semester of [teaching](/teaching/) has begun! I'm teaching
two sections of Calculus 2 at my new university: The University of
South Alabama.

I've flipped the classroom this semester, so students will watch
YouTube lectures posted to that site, and then work on problems in
the classroom with me and their classmates.
