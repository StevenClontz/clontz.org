I'm very excited to announce that my book of logic puzzles,
including 25 "cryptic" or puzzlehunt-style puzzles,
will be published in Feburary!

[![book](/img/2020book.jpg)](https://smile.amazon.com/Tricky-Logic-Puzzles-Adults-Difficult/dp/1646111451/)

It will be available on
[Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Tricky-Logic-Puzzles-Adults-Difficult/dp/1646111451/)
and wherever else books are sold.

Thanks to Andrea Blumberg, Bryan Clair, Phillip Clontz, Tracy Cobbs, Jenn Dumont, Julie Gaddy, Steve Gaddy, Eric Harshbarger, Charles McPillan, Erin McPillan, Trent Webb, and my wife and daughter for their support in the writing of the book. And special thanks go to Andrea, Bryan, Eric, and Jenn for letting me adapt four great puzzles of theirs for the book!

## Sample Puzzles

As the release date approaches, I'll be sharing some of the kinds of puzzles
I hope you'll enjoy in the book.

### Nonogram

First up, here's a
[nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram), also known as
color-by-number or Picross. The puzzle below was one of a few
cut from the final manuscript to get
the page length (and price!) down, but hey, that means I can share it
here instead! Here's an excerpt from the book explaining them,
and a [completed example from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram#/media/File:Nonogram_wiki.svg).

> Nonogram puzzles are known by a wide variety of names: Picross, Paint-By-
> Number, Griddlers, Logic Art, and many more! Solving (and designing!)
> puzzles are a particular joy, because rather than the final answer being an
> arbitrary grid of numbers or symbols, the end result is a pixelated image. Half
> the fun is figuring out what youâ€™re drawing as you solve.
> 
> In a nonogram, each cell of the grid will either be left blank, or filled-in. To solve,
> consider the numbers at the boundaries. Each number represents a continuous
> block of filled-in squares, ordered top-to-bottom or left-to-right.

Credit for the great Javascript library used to create the
interactive nonogram above goes to
<https://handsomeone.github.io/Nonogram/>. (I also used
the library to help design the puzzles in the first place,
so really, thanks!)

### Calcudoku

[Calcudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen)
puzzles, also known under the (trademarked) name KenKen,
are a fun blend of logic and arithmetic. Like a Sudoku,
each number used in the puzzle should appear exactly once in
each row and column. Unlike Sudoku, they might be repeated in
each region, called a cage; instead, each cage designates
a certain arithmetic property that must be satisfied by
its numbers.

Since the below example is a \\(7\times 7\\) grid, it should
be filled using the numbers 1 through 7.
