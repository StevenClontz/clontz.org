I'm very excited to announce that my book of logic puzzles,
including 25 "cryptic" or puzzlehunt-style puzzles,
has been published!

[![book](/img/2020book.jpg)](https://smile.amazon.com/Tricky-Logic-Puzzles-Adults-Difficult/dp/1646111451/)

It will be available on
[Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Tricky-Logic-Puzzles-Adults-Difficult/dp/1646111451/)
and wherever else books are sold.

Thanks to Andrea Blumberg, Bryan Clair, Phillip Clontz, Tracy Cobbs, Jenn Dumont, Julie Gaddy, Steve Gaddy, Eric Harshbarger, Charles McPillan, Erin McPillan, Trent Webb, and my wife and daughter for their support in the writing of the book. And special thanks go to Andrea, Bryan, Eric, and Jenn for letting me adapt four great puzzles of theirs for the book!

## Sample Puzzles

As the release date approaches, I'll be sharing some of the kinds of puzzles
I hope you'll enjoy in the book.

### Nonogram

First up, here's a
[nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram), also known as
color-by-number or Picross. The puzzle below was one of a few
cut from the final manuscript to get
the page length (and price!) down, but hey, that means I can share it
here instead! Here's an excerpt from the book explaining them,
and a [completed example from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram#/media/File:Nonogram_wiki.svg).

> Nonogram puzzles are known by a wide variety of names: Picross, Paint-By-
> Number, Griddlers, Logic Art, and many more! Solving (and designing!)
> puzzles are a particular joy, because rather than the final answer being an
> arbitrary grid of numbers or symbols, the end result is a pixelated image. Half
> the fun is figuring out what you’re drawing as you solve.
> 
> In a nonogram, each cell of the grid will either be left blank, or filled-in. To solve,
> consider the numbers at the boundaries. Each number represents a continuous
> block of filled-in squares, ordered top-to-bottom or left-to-right.

### Calcudoku

[Calcudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen)
puzzles, also known under the (trademarked) name KenKen,
are a fun blend of logic and arithmetic.


> A Calcudoku puzzle uses the numbers 1 through 4 for a 4 by 4
> puzzle, 1 through 5 for a 5 by 5 puzzle, and so on.
> Like Sudoku, each row and column must contain each of the
> numbers for the puzzle exactly once (creating what
> mathematicians call a Latin square).
> But since, unlike a Sudoku puzzle, none of the numbers are
> provided, you'll need to use logic
> to place the numbers in each cell according to the clues
> given in each "cage". Addition \\((+)\\) or
> multiplication \\((\times)\\) clues describe the sum or product
> of the caged numbers. Subtraction \\((-)\\)
> or division
> \\((\\div)\\) clues describe the difference or quotient of the
> larger number by the smaller number in the cage
> (which always has two cells). Numbers can be repeated
> within a cage, as long as they don't share a row
> or column.

Since the below example is a \\(7\times 7\\) grid, it should
be filled using the numbers 1 through 7.
The book contains Calcudoku puzzles between
\\(4\times4\\) and \\(8\times8\\).
To print and enjoy, the below image links to a PDF.

### Logic Grids

I couldn't resist including a few classic logic grid puzzles
into my book!

> Logic Grid puzzles are perhaps the purest type of
> logic puzzle, since no explanation of the mechanics
> is necssary. All you have to do is use logic to figure
> out the relationships between the various people or
> items being discussed. 
> 
> But don't let that fool you into
> thinking they are easy! That's where the grid comes
> into play. Using it, you can make notes on the
> relationships between each pair of properties,
> ruling out the impossible until only the possible
> remains.

Five neighbors, conveniently named Alice, Bob, Carl,
Diana, and Eve, live in a row of five houses of
different colors, with different pets, and preferring
different beverages. Using the clues below, can you
determine who is who?

- Diana lives in the rightmost house, not the blue house.
- The coffee-drinker lives next to the green house.
- The owner of the fox prefers water.
- Carl enjoys tea.
- The person who likes milk dislikes snails.
- The fox lives in a yellow house.
- The ivory house is located to the left of Alice's house.
- Diana owns a zebra.
- The fridge in the rightmost house holds a lot of OJ.
- Bob lives somewhere to the right of the red house.
- Carl lives nextdoor to the leftmost house.
- The dog owner is an immediate neighbor of Diana.
- Alice lives in a red house.

The grid below links to a nifty web app that you can
use to help solve the puzzle. There's even an option
that will help autofill the grid if you'd like some extra help
("Draw Conclusions"), or you can
leave it all up to yourself ("No support").

<!-- spoilers omg
Answers:
first house: Eve, yellow, water, fox, 
second house: Carl, ivory, tea, snails, 
middle house: Alice, red, milk, horse, 
fourth house: Bob, blue, coffee, dog, 
last house: Diana, green, orange juice, zebra,

### Sudoku

Are you allowed to write a book of logic puzzles *without* Sudoku?
I'm not sure you can. I certainly didn't!

> In case this is your first experience with this popular puzzle
> format, the rules are simple: fill in the numbers 1-9 within
> the grid so that each number appears exactly once in each
> row, column, and 3x3 subsquare.

### Masyu

While I've worked with all the other puzzle types for a long time,
to be honest I'm a very recent Masyu solver! And boy was I missing
out -- these challenges are a lot of fun!

> The task at hand is to draw a single cycle of horizontal
> and vertical lines that passes through each box that
> contains a circle. Lines that pass through black circles
> must do so at a 90° angle, but must pass straight
> through both adjacent squares. On the other hand, lines
> must pass straight through white circles, but must
> turn 90° through one adjacent square (or possibly
> both). Not every square of the grid must be passed through.

Of course, they say a
[picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masyu#/media/File:Masyu_puzzle_solution.svg)
is worth a thousand words. A printable puzzle is available
through the picture link below.

### Cryptic Puzzles

My final and favorite puzzles found
in the book are known as cryptic puzzles,
also known as puzzlehunt-style puzzles. These puzzles
require logic and creative thinking to extract a hidden
word or phrase. Not all readers may be familiar with this
genre, so the first few cryptic puzzles are based upon
the other five puzzle types found in the book.

In my teaser cryptic puzzle, you'll want to think about
both Sudoku and Masyu, and use the common encoding of
`A=1`, `B=2`, etc. to discover the hidden 5-letter English
word.

## Errata (warning: spoilers)

Sometimes typos and mistakes sneak past you! We'll be correcting
any errors we find for a future printing, but in the meantime I'll
document them here. Of course, be wary of spoilers below.

- Logic Grid 11 is uniquely solvable as-is, but it's harder than intended
for such an early puzzle.
Future reprints will include the following additional
clue: "The hiker didn't arrive first."
- The solution to Nonogram 27 is incorrect.
The cell in row 7, column 9 should be unfilled.
- In Logic Grids 40, 81, and 124, there is no purposeful relationship
between the presumed gender of each student and their grades or preferred subjects.
In future printings, I'd prefer to use the names Aiden, Blake, Cassidy,
Dana, and Elliot.
- The hint to Logic Grid 55 is incorrect.
It should read "Doug finished fourth."
- In Sudoku 56, a `1` should be provided in the middle row and rightmost
column to guarantee a unique solution.
- In Nonogram 62, the hint refers to column 12, not column 11.
- The solution to Masyu 77 is incorrect. The correct solution
is [given here](/img/20200126/masyu77.png).
- The hint to Cryptic Puzzle 85 should refer to \\(+\\) and \\(\times\\).
- The sentence at the top of Cryptic Puzzle 101 isn't as cryptic as I intended!
- I've gotten reports that the back-of-the-book solution to Nonogram 134
is difficult to scan with some barcode readers / phone cameras since it
is printed in light blue, rather than black.
If your phone can't pick it up, click [this link](http://w.wiki/5$4) instead
to see where it points to.
- The semaphore code for N given in the code sheet is incorrect.
A correct listing of semaphore is given at
[this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore#Characters).
