I'm very excited to announce that my book of logic puzzles,
including 25 "cryptic" or puzzlehunt-style puzzles,
will be published in Feburary!

[![book](/img/2020book.jpg)](https://smile.amazon.com/Tricky-Logic-Puzzles-Adults-Difficult/dp/1646111451/)

It will be available on
[Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Tricky-Logic-Puzzles-Adults-Difficult/dp/1646111451/)
and wherever else books are sold.

Thanks to Andrea Blumberg, Bryan Clair, Phillip Clontz, Tracy Cobbs, Jenn Dumont, Julie Gaddy, Steve Gaddy, Eric Harshbarger, Charles McPillan, Erin McPillan, Trent Webb, and my wife and daughter for their support in the writing of the book. And special thanks go to Andrea, Bryan, Eric, and Jenn for letting me adapt four great puzzles of theirs for the book!

## Sample Puzzles

As the release date approaches, I'll be sharing some of the kinds of puzzles
I hope you'll enjoy in the book.

### Nonogram

First up, here's a
[nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram), also known as
color-by-number or Picross. The puzzle below was one of a few
cut from the final manuscript to get
the page length (and price!) down, but hey, that means I can share it
here instead! Here's an excerpt from the book explaining them,
and a [completed example from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram#/media/File:Nonogram_wiki.svg).

> Nonogram puzzles are known by a wide variety of names: Picross, Paint-By-
> Number, Griddlers, Logic Art, and many more! Solving (and designing!)
> puzzles are a particular joy, because rather than the final answer being an
> arbitrary grid of numbers or symbols, the end result is a pixelated image. Half
> the fun is figuring out what youâ€™re drawing as you solve.
> 
> In a nonogram, each cell of the grid will either be left blank, or filled-in. To solve,
> consider the numbers at the boundaries. Each number represents a continuous
> block of filled-in squares, ordered top-to-bottom or left-to-right.

);

### Calcudoku

[Calcudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen)
puzzles, also known under the (trademarked) name KenKen,
are a fun blend of logic and arithmetic.


> A Calcudoku puzzle uses the numbers 1 through 4 for a 4 by 4
> puzzle, 1 through 5 for a 5 by 5 puzzle, and so on.
> Like Sudoku, each row and column must contain each of the
> numbers for the puzzle exactly once (creating what
> mathematicians call a Latin square).
> But since, unlike a Sudoku puzzle, none of the numbers are
> provided, you'll need to use logic
> to place the numbers in each cell according to the clues
> given in each "cage". Addition \\((+)\\) or
> multiplication \\((\times)\\) clues describe the sum or product
> of the caged numbers. Subtraction \\((-)\\)
> or division
> \\((\\div)\\) clues describe the difference or quotient of the
> larger number by the smaller number in the cage
> (which always has two cells). Numbers can be repeated
> within a cage, as long as they don't share a row
> or column.

Since the below example is a \\(7\times 7\\) grid, it should
be filled using the numbers 1 through 7.
The book contains Calcudoku puzzles between
\\(4\times4\\) and \\(8\times8\\).
To print and enjoy, the below image links to a PDF.

### Logic Grids

I couldn't resist including a few classic logic grid puzzles
into my book!

> Logic Grid puzzles are perhaps the purest type of
> logic puzzle, since no explanation of the mechanics
> is necssary. All you have to do is use logic to figure
> out the relationships between the various people or
> items being discussed. 
> 
> But don't let that fool you into
> thinking they are easy! That's where the grid comes
> into play. Using it, you can make notes on the
> relationships between each pair of properties,
> ruling out the impossible until only the possible
> remains.

- Diana lives in the rightmost house, not the blue house.
- The coffee-drinker lives next to the green house.
- The owner of the fox prefers water.
- Carl enjoys tea.
- The person who likes milk dislikes snails.
- The fox lives in a yellow house.
- The ivory house is located to the left of Alice's house.
- Diana owns a zebra.
- The fridge in the rightmost house holds a lot of OJ.
- Bob lives somewhere to the right of the red house.
- Carl lives nextdoor to the leftmost house.
- The dog owner is an immediate neighbor of Diana.
- Alice lives in a red house.

The grid below links to a nifty web app that you can
use to help solve the grid. There are a few options
that will help autofill the grid if you like, or
leave it all up to you.
