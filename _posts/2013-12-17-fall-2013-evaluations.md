My last class teaching at Auburn came sooner than expected. Starting in the spring, I'll be working as the software engineer / web developer / IT specialist for Auburn's [Office of University Writing](https://fp.auburn.edu/writing/), specifically the [ePortfolio Project](https://fp.auburn.edu/writing/eportfolio-project/). I'm sure I'll post more about that down the road - I start on January 7th.

I had a great group of students in this final semester. And it seems they thought I was okay too.

> Best math teacher I've had at Auburn. Seems like he's having fun teaching and really enjoys his job here at Auburn. He isn't as mundane as the rest of the math department's professors and teachers. Overall, a funny nice guy with a great attitude and a love for what he's doing.

I added more on my [teaching](/teaching/) page.
