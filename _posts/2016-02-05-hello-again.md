A lot's gone on since the last time I updated the site.
I took a visiting position at [UNC Charlotte](http://uncc.edu),
founded [Mathematical Puzzle Programs](http://mappmath.org),
did some consulting with the [National Museum of Math](http://momath.org/),
and designed a puzzle challenge for
[The Leaders Foundry](http://www.theleadersfoundry.com/).

With a fresh coat of paint (courtesy
<http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/clean-blog/>) I plan to keep this
site better updated with my projects and musings.
