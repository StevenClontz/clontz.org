Since I recently relaunched my [grade calculator website](http://gradecalc.stevenclontz.com) I wanted to see how the month of finals affected my traffic.

Basically, over a 1000 daily visits around the week before Christmas, compared to fifteen total concerned students on Christmas day.

While these stats aren't surprising, I suppose it's a nice confirmation that my analytics software passes the eyeball test for realistic statistics. When I moved off of auburn.edu I took a major hit in my Google ranking however - it'd be interesting to have statistics from a year ago (I unfortunately did not have my tracking code up and running).
