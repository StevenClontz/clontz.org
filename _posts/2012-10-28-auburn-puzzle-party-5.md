In case you hadn't heard me talk about it yet, [here's my wrap-up of Auburn Puzzle Party 5](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/APP5_Wrap-Up) on the Auburn Puzzle Party wiki.

And if you haven't checked out the [APP5 videos, including the Puzzle Rock Anthem](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLooILs0YfKkEWPeFpZdDis2GuQ2aP-weO) yet, you're missing out. See if you can solve the "hidden" puzzle in the videos too.
