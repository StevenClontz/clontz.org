Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out my new blog*. After deciding I didn't need to waste so much cash on domain names I don't use and web space I barely needed, I took down stevenclontz.com along with most of my other old PHP/Wordpress sites. I'll get stevenclontz.com to point here sometime soon.

Thanks to [James Dabbs](http://jdabbs.com) for showing [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) to me the other day - a blogging system with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) revision control and hosting by [Heroku](http://heroku.com) sounds alright to me.

I'll be working on my [About](/about/) page and getting my [Resume](http://resume.stevenclontz.com) up to date over the coming days.  Email me at <steven.clontz@gmail.com> if you need to get in touch with me! See ya.

<small>*Is this sentence obligatory for a first blog post? I almost always see it, and it sounded awkward not to include it. Thanks again I guess. :-)</small>
