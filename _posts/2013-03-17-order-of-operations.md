This is a problem that's been thrown around the Facebook recently it seems. Man, it seems so simple:

$$6÷2(1+2)=?$$

Simple until you ask a group of people what the answer is, and find out half of us think it's nine, and the other half think it's one.

So what IS the answer?

<!-- more -->

Short answer: it's a terribly written problem, or more accurately, it's a problem written solely to make people argue over its order of operations. It touches on the ambiguity of parentheses, multiplication, and division in the "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally / Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction" mnemonic.

The issue stems from the incorrect (but often subconscious) belief that there exists a Bible of Mathematics somewhere, which decrees every detail of how arithmetic should be expressed and simplified. As simple as the problem seems, there's no prevailing convention on whether $6÷2$ or $2(1+2)$ gets precedence here. Particularly when half of school teachers say multiplication has precedence over division, and half say multiplication and division have equal precedence and are evaluated left-to-right. (And hey does implied multiplication by parentheses fall into the P or M of PEMDAS?)

In the real world of mathematics, this is as unanswerable a question as me asking "Is there a mathematical size bigger than the amount of integers but less than the amount of real numbers?" [\[1\]](#footnote-1) because you can't address it without first specifying the rules you are allowed to use on the problem.

Thus I'm forced to settle for what we call a "consistency result": 

> If ÷ division takes precedence over implied multiplication located further to the right, then $6÷2(1+2)=9$. If not, then $6÷2(1+2)=1$.

That's the best that can be done, mathematically. If you wanted a definitive answer, you should have asked me to evaluate $(6÷2)(1+2)$ or $6÷(2(1+2))$. That's what parentheses are for, anyway.

<small id="footnote-1">[1] This is something called [The Continuum Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis). We use the word "hypothesis" here because once mathematicians formalized the rules of set theory (well, [one set of rules for set theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory)), it couldn't be proven true or false. We later proved that it *couldn't* be proven true or false, basically because we didn't provide enough rules to handle the question. So just like $6÷2(1+2)=9$ or $6÷2(1+2)=1$ depending on what rules we use, we can assume the answer to the Continuum Hypothesis is either yes *or* no.

Or we can completely ignore it and go on with our lives, just like we do with other silly questions like $6÷2(1+2)=?$.</small>

Addendum: Someone rightfully pointed out on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5391415) that calling the Continuum Hypothesis a "silly" question doesn't do it justice. Rather, I mean that posing the Continuum Hypothesis as a "yes or no" question is silly.
