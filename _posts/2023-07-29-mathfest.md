It's wild that it's 2023 and there's no official virtual option for participation
in MAA's 2023 MathFest hosted in Tampa!

(See this [open letter to the MAA](https://inclusionexclusion.org/2023/07/13/an-open-letter-to-the-maa/).)

I'm obligated to be there for many reasons, so I'll use this space to share
how I hope to serve those who cannot be there in person, but may be interested
in my contributions to the meeting.

## Project NExT / Outcomes-based grading

I'm not a Project NExTer myself, but I've been asked to help them out with a couple of
activities focused on outcomes-based grading.

The MAA has provided an
[open Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rr1i5-Z87LckN4AejT_USNBt-J7FgfSa?usp=sharing)
where I'll post all my resources for these activities.

## The PROSE Consortium exhibit booth

Most of my time will be spent in the Exhibit Hall, booth 107, representing
[The PROSE Consortium](https://prose.runestone.academy) of open-source educational
technologies and resources.

For information on virtual engagement with our booth through
our [Zoom dropin link](https://prose.runestone.academy/dropin/), keep an eye on
the [PreTeXt Announcement Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/pretext-announce).

## Mathematical Puzzle Programs

I'm revealing our new poster for [MaPPmath.org](https://www.mappmath.org)
between 9:00-10:30am Eastern time on Thursday August 3rd at the Outreach Activities
Poster Session at the Exhibit Hall. This poster will include three puzzles,
paired with a website providing a PDF copy of the poster, a form to check solutions,
and hints.

Earlier that morning I will add a link to that website here.

## Team-Based Inquiry Learning Resource Library

I'm giving a short talk demonstrating how to adopt [Library.TBIL.org](http://library.tbil.org)
to implement Team-Based Inquiry Learning for single-variable Calculus or Linear Algebra.
This will take place 2:40-2:55pm Eastern time on Thursday August 3rd (in Room 115/116
for those there in person).

Barring technical difficulties, I plan to simulcast this presentation at
[Clontz.org/zoom](https://clontz.org/zoom/).
