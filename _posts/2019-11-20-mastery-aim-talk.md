The majority of this presentation is anticipated to be a demonstration
of various tools I use or have created for mastery grading, but
here are a few notes that I'll be using during my talk.

Credit goes to Dr. Drew Lewis who provided his slides on
"Standards Based and Specifciations Grading" which inspired some
of this talk.

## Opening Activities

- What are some reasons for assigning grades to students?
- What grade do the following students deserve?

- What are some benefits of percentage-based grading systems?

## Axioms of Mastery Grading

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m giving a talk on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MasteryGrading?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MasteryGrading</a> next month, so I&#39;m curious. In your opinion, what is an &quot;axiom&quot; for your teaching that motivates the use of mastery grading? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sbgchat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sbgchat</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtbos?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mtbos</a></p>&mdash; Steven Clontz (@StevenXClontz) <a href="https://twitter.com/StevenXClontz/status/1197259388588822529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- I am more interested in what students learn than when they learn it or how many tries it takes them to learn it.
- Students are not all like me. They are wonderfully diverse in so many ways.
- Any single assessment is not a valid measure of learning.
- Learning takes time and involves mistakes.
- Grades should represent eventual understanding rather than speed/time required.
- We learn more from failure than success. So providing opportunities to fail without penalty (and therefore incentives to try despite the fear of failure) is critical to an effective grading system.
- Conversations with students are best when they are about math or tacos.
- Misconceptions snowball; don't let them take root.
- The grading structure of the class should help motivate student learning.
- Learning comes from mistakes.
- The incentive structure of grades should encourage good learning behaviors.
- Final grades should be as pure a function of student learning as possible.

## What is Mastery Grading?

According to <https://www.masterygrading.com/>...

- Mastery grading is an approach to student assessment in which student work is graded 
directly on whether it demonstrates mastery of a clear list of objectives. 
- Rather than using points or partial credit, final grades are based on the degree of 
mastery each student has demonstrated of the objectives by the end of the course. 
- Students typically have (or can earn) multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery of 
each objective.
- Mastery grading puts emphasis on learning, provides clarity for students, and 
encourages perseverance and growth mindset.
