Here are some notes that accompany my presentation on Mastery
Grading at the
[American Institute of Mathematics workshop on Interactive Asessments in OER](https://aimath.org/workshops/interacttextbook/).

## Opening Activities

- What are some reasons for assigning grades to students?
- What grade do the following students deserve? *Credit to
  D. Lewis for this activity.*

- What are some benefits of percentage-based grading systems?

## Axioms of Mastery Grading

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m giving a talk on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MasteryGrading?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MasteryGrading</a> next month, so I&#39;m curious. In your opinion, what is an &quot;axiom&quot; for your teaching that motivates the use of mastery grading? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sbgchat?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sbgchat</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtbos?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mtbos</a></p>&mdash; Steven Clontz (@StevenXClontz) <a href="https://twitter.com/StevenXClontz/status/1197259388588822529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- I am more interested in what students learn than when they learn it or how many tries it takes them to learn it.
- Students are not all like me. They are wonderfully diverse in so many ways.
- Any single assessment is not a valid measure of learning.
- Learning takes time and involves mistakes.
- Grades should represent eventual understanding rather than speed/time required.
- We learn more from failure than success. So providing opportunities to fail without penalty (and therefore incentives to try despite the fear of failure) is critical to an effective grading system.
- Conversations with students are best when they are about math or tacos.
- Misconceptions snowball; don't let them take root.
- The grading structure of the class should help motivate student learning.
- Learning comes from mistakes.
- The incentive structure of grades should encourage good learning behaviors.
- Final grades should be as pure a function of student learning as possible.

## What is Mastery Grading?

According to <https://www.masterygrading.com/> (**emphasis** added by me)...

- Mastery grading is an approach to student assessment in which student work is graded 
directly on whether it demonstrates mastery of a clear list of objectives. 
- Rather than using points or partial credit, final grades are based on the degree of 
mastery each student has demonstrated of the objectives by the end of the course. 
- Students typically have (or can earn) multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery of 
each objective.
- Mastery grading puts emphasis on learning, provides clarity for students, and 
encourages perseverance and **growth mindset**.

## Demo of Mastery Grading Tools

There are many different ways to implement mastery grading
(e.g. standards-based grading, specifications grading...).
At the workshop I will walk through my implementation of mastery
grading for my 2019 Fall course on sophomore differential equations.

- [MA238 Learning Standards](https://prof.clontz.org/classes/2019/08/ma238/standards/)
- [MA238 Syllabus](https://prof.clontz.org/classes/2019/08/ma238/)
- [SbgRails](https://github.com/stevenclontz/sbg-rails)
- [Mastr](https://mastr.clontz.org)
- [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/)

Also needs to be mentioned: Sharona Krinsey's
