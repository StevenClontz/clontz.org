I will be presenting my research tomorrow morning (2013-02-27) for the Graduate Student Council Scholars' Forum, a preliminary event for AU Research Week. It's intended to showcase graduate student research for a general audience.

Hopefully I'll do an okay job! If you're interested in my research, I've made the presentation available on [GitHub](https://github.com/StevenClontz/2013-au-research-week-presentation/) (and [added a page to my site](/aurw-2013/)).
