My team won [EPP14](http://www.ericharshbarger.org/epp/2014/)!

I added a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StevenClontz/epp14)
which has the code I wrote to tackle three of the puzzles, but the most fun
I had was surprising not the mathematics and coding.

<!-- more -->

Nope, it was playing *Adventure* for the Atari 2600.

The Easter Egg-themed puzzlehunt was capped off by an old-school hidden
puzzle. I was very fortunate to be on a team with several other talented
puzzlers, since I wouldn't have cracked the code that got me to the
Atari joystick. But once there, I managed to uncover the 
[first video game Easter Egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_%281979_video_game%29#Easter_egg)
in just over 17 minutes. Normal puzzles were worth 100 points, but this
hidden puzzle was worth up to 300 points, minus 3 points per minute
expired in finding the egg, scoring us 249 points.

It almost made up for the 200-300 points we destroyed by dropping our
egg in the Egg Toss earlier that day. :-)

Again, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/StevenClontz/epp14) to
learn more about the coding I did to solve a few puzzles, and I'm sure Eric
will update his [EPP14 page](http://www.ericharshbarger.org/epp/2014/)
with more information on the party and puzzles after a well-deserved rest.
Here's to another great game, Mr. Harshbarger!
