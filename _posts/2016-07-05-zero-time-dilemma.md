The [Zero Escape trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Escape)
is my favorite video game series. To be clear, I'm not claiming it's the
*best*, but merely my favorite. Its escape rooms can be hit-or-miss, but
the stories in each game have kept me up to 3am many nights as I tried
to unravel their intricate storylines.

What's so great about their plots? Well, unfortunately, telling you would
be a huge spoiler! I can say this: each game pushes the boundaries of
story-telling within the visual novel format just a little further.

Unfortunately, there are a few questionable design
decisions with the latest game, Zero Time Dilemma, which can block players'
progress through the game.
Most of them could have been
solved with a better hinting system, not only within the escape rooms,
but also in how to progress the story itself. Normally such problems can
be solved by checking Google for answers, but in a game like ZTD, it's
very easy to run across spoilers which will detract from the player's
experience for a first playthrough.

My goal for this post (which is currently a work in progress) is to
provide first-time players a guide to push them in the correct direction,
without any risk of spoilers. It should be referred to sparingly, and
only when the player feels she does not know how to proceed in furthering
the story.

![Fragments](/img/20160705/fragment.jpg)  
*To emulate the loss of the characters' memories, gameplay is fragmented into
several sections.*

![Global](/img/20160705/global.jpg)  
*As more of the story is revealed, the fragmented storylines are positioned
within a branching timeline, based upon the choices of the characters.*

When it is unclear how to progress the story, the player either has to make
a new **Decision** (marked with a balance scale on the flowchart),
or needs to complete a **Quest** (often, escape a room; marked with a door
on the flowchart).
Searching online for Quest walkthroughs is easy enough, and has little risk
for spoilers, so I'll be focusing on the several Decision games. Here's an
example:

* **Read Spoiler?** (example)
    * Outcome 1
        * Prerequisite:
          <span class="spoiler">CQD-END:2</span>
        * Hint 1:
          <span class="spoiler">Think about this Decision's title.</span>
        * Hint 2:
          <span class="spoiler">Well, you aren't going to WRITE it.</span>
        * Choice:
          <span class="spoiler">"READ"</span>
    * Outcome 2
        * Prerequisite: none
        * Choice:
          <span class="spoiler">"DONT", or let time expire</span>

The outcomes are numbered as they appear left-to-right on the fragment and
global flowcharts, not necessarily in the order they should be played.
The given prerequisites are not enforced by the game; however, unless you've
fulfilled them, then you shouldn't expect to know how to make that choice
at that point of the game (and should try doing something else for now).
Here's my suggestions before using this guide:

1. Play any Fragments marked New.
2. Play any nodes of the Global Flowchart marked with an exclamation point.
3. Read my *Note on Execution Voting* for an explanation
   on how to get all the Execution Results.
4. Look for a Decision you are missing outcomes for on the Global Flowchart
   in the below list. If you have satisfied its prerequisites, then peek
   at its hints. If you give up, read its choice and move on.

Shoot me feedback on the Reddit post here: (TODO).

## Note on Execution Voting

My biggest peeve with Zero Time Dilemma
is the lack of clarity in how to trigger the different
Execution Results. You may reasonably think that as soon as your flowchart
contains the appropriate Decisions to execute another team, the game should
recognize that execution.

But nope. Instead, the game secretly stores the latest Decisions you made
for each team in Execution Vote: C/Q/D. So, you need to be careful of the
order you make your Decisions, or go back and redo all three each time.
For your convenience,
here's one of the quickest ways you can trigger all four Election Results:

* C votes for D
* D votes for Q
* Q votes for C
    * All Teams Survived
* C votes for Q
    * Q-Team Executed
* D votes for C
    * C-Team Executed
* Q votes for D
* C votes for D
    * D-Team Executed
