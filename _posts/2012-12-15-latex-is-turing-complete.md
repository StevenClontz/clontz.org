So, I knew [LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) was the best mathematical markup out there, but I didn't realize it was Turing complete. Here's an article that shows how to compute the Fibonacci sequence:

Makes me wonder where I can save myself some time by having LaTeX do certain computations for me in my paper rather than doing them myself? I suppose this would likely negatively affect compile time, however.
