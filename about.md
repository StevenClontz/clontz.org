## Life

I grew up in the suburbs outside Huntsville, Alabama, graduating from
Buckhorn High School (home of the Bucks, go Bucks). Following that I
spent eleven years at [Auburn Univeristy](http://www.auburn.edu),
eventually earning my PhD in mathematics
with a specialization in topology and game theory.

I met my wife Jessica while she was studying education at Auburn, and
we married in June 2011. Since then she has earned two
masters degrees in educational leadership and library
media (which, she likes to add, is more masters degrees than I have).

Currently we live and work in Charlotte, North Carolina, where
I serve as Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at
[UNC Charlotte](http://uncc.edu). I am also an active freelance
consultant and puzzle designer - shoot me an
